## Tuesday
Dressed the side of the cut 6 file for filing squares on the lathe. Completed stepped bar exercise.

Cleaned the case of my grandfather's watch from the 90's in the ultra sonic tank. No movement replacement necessary, only battery change.

The watch is reminiscent of Pope Francis' wristwatch, the Casio MQ-24, which I was going to buy, but found my granddad's equally simple 90's Japanese quartz instead.

The [Q&Q](https://qq-watch.jp/eng/about/index.html) brand is a subsidiary of Citizen Watch Company, producing watches with Miyota movements.

Later in the day, we were introduced to the graver sharpening support tool, making the task of sharpening gravers not require loosing the feeling in the tips of your fingers. The tool gives a perfect flat, and when set up correctly, perfect symmetry and angle. Only downside is that it takes a few minutes to set up and you can't put in the graver back in the exact same position as before, meaning you have to sharpen at a slightly different position each time.

For a quick re-sharpening, doing it by hand is still more economic.

## Wednesday
Practiced filing square to dimension. I need to improve on the taper that I'm getting due possibly to deflection.

Improved the slotting graver using the sharpening tool, and completed the slotting bar exercise.

## Thursday
Turned square shaft blanks, that is: set dimension bars with 90 degree points on both ends. Set up the hand wheel and did basic turning on it to practice coordination.

## Friday
I was behind on the hand wheel work this week, so instead of doing work on the project watch, I got on with turning the square shaft blanks.

This included turning a shoulder and diameter to dimension, for four different pieces, two of which I finished today.

We had a look at two watch movements under the microscopes. First is the movement of the [moon-phase Speedmaster](https://www.omegawatches.com/en-gb/watch-omega-speedmaster-moonwatch-chronograph-42-mm-35765000), the Omega 1866:

Last, was a Wempe Chronometer calibre from Glash√ºtte:
