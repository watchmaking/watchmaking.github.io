## Monday
Written up final plan for exam, detailing each step.

Milled and tapped hardening plates to experiment hardening the setting lever jumper with, without warping.

The hardening plates didn't work well. It was difficult to get both to cherry red as even at 1mm each, they were still too thick. In addition, the screws I used hardened and one of them snapped.

Practiced bevelling straight edges of brass dynamic poising support tool. Watched the ["Philippe DuFour explains watchmaking techniques that are almost forgotten"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZqNrGDk3q8) video for tips.

## Tuesday
Relaxed the setting lever jumper prototype without plates or binding wire -- no warping. Tried hardening this time on a single plate, wrapped loosely with iron binding wire -- the component might have warped, will need to try again this week.

Relaxed the prototype again, and filed it to shape, revising the design. Filed with finer files, used a degussit stone on the bevels, burnished, and straight grained. I'm happy with the results of this quick prototype.

## Wednesday
Exam started at 8am. Filed the anvil and pusher box lid to upper tolerance before 12pm. Broke a 0.9mm tungsten drill but managed to get it out. Marked the side quite deep when zeroing on the side with a milling cutter using a thin paper (when slowly getting closer with the cutter, turning it by hand back and forth, the paper should move and at that point we zero the DRO -- the paper didn't move and the cutter bit into the work). Additionally, I added the wrong paper thickness when zeroing (added 0.1 instead of 0.01). Nothing else went wrong that I was aware of -- finished the project after 4pm.

## Thursday
I improved the hardening and tempering of the setting lever jumper method, without warping. The key was to wrap the component a lot more tightly around the plate with the iron binding wire. Also had to ensure beforehand, that the angle of the jumper paw itself is correct -- only then do I harden it.

Tempering was more difficult because of the odd shape of the piece. I heated up a brass plate and carefully, with tweezers, I placed different parts of the setting lever jumper on the plate. The goal was a purple-blue colour, which I was able to achieve on the jumper arm but not quite on the body. Nevertheless, I have a method for hardening and tempering this component. The key is slow, patient work.

I received my results from the box lid exam: 90%. The mistakes were:
 - frosting effect around edges because of straight graining on 180 grit sand paper;
 - milling cutter zeroing mark;
 - no burrs which is good, but the bevels were sharp;
 - inconsistent finishing on bottom of one leg;
 - the center holes were off-center, because I added the zeroing paper-thickness incorrectly.

Did further bevelling practice on the dynamic poising support. Later, I marked out the four slots and started sawing them.

## Friday
We spent the day servicing our 8mm Horia motor and hand lathes, as well as the hand wheels.

We will be sharpening gravers next week.

During lunch I filed the final setting lever jumper to shape. I should have the piece finished some time next week.

## Project Watch: Yoke and Yoke Spring
I can't come up with an aesthetically pleasing design of a yoke and yoke spring in-one for the ETA 6498-1. The boot end of the yoke always looks too large in my Photoshop designs. Because of this, I decided to have two separate components: the yoke and a traditional yoke spring. The yoke will be held down by a screw, around which it will pivot. The yoke spring will consist of a screw and at least one pin. Something like this comes to mind:

I will use the existing yoke from the 6498-1 calibre and finish it with bevelling and straight graining. The traditional yoke spring will need to be designed and manufactured from scratch. Both operations require drilling and tapping holes in the base plate for the screws.
