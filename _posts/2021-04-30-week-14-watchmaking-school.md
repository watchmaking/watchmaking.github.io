## Monday & Tuesday
Started brass cube project.

![Work in progress brass cube](/images/student-blog/wip-brass-cube.jpeg)

Finished on Tuesday with good tolerances and flatness but poorer squareness. The brass cube was signed off but I started on a steel cube in order to challenge myself.

Tried bluing black polished screws using the screw bluing plate I made last week. I forgot to clean the screws after they've been sitting in my drawer for a week. The bluing results were poor because of lack of cleanliness.

We were informed of exam dates, which are as follows this year:
 - 12 May, anvil box lid
 - 28 July, winding stem
 - 29 September, balance staff
 - 8 December, gear train

And these in 2022:
 - 3 February, escapement
 - 18--19 May, hairspring
 - final exam date to be announced

## Wednesday
Continued with the steel cube. Difficult to describe but achieving flatness is harder than with brass.

Milled, drilled, and tapped sawing support bottom part.

## Thursday
Finished steel cube. The flatness and squareness were good but I ran out of tolerance to give the steel cube a nice straight brushed finish. If I were to attempt the cube the third time I'd know how to reconcile tolerance/dimensions, flatness, squareness, and finish. The project, seemingly pointless, benefited my dexterity and patience.

The countersink tool for the mill arrived, and I was able to countersink the sawing support top.

At the end of the day, we discussed project watches, specifically the click spring. From this discussion [I wrote up initial ideas and notes](/student-blog/project-watch-initial-ideas).

## Friday
Cut stock and filed dynamic poising support tool.

Straight-grained the sawing support elements but still need to finish to tolerance.

After school on Thursday I created a milling machine controls poster as I kept getting confused as to which way to turn the X, Y, Z axis and which digital readout buttons to press for which axis. I will get this printed, laminated, and placed beside the milling machine.

It seems that this isn't just my forgetting, but this confusion takes place in people who haven't used the machine for a while. I noticed this is mentioned in the [Greubel Forsey Hand Made 1 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EogfBeSQ158).
