## Monday
Cut 44 mm brass stock for the Schaublin brass staking block project.

Trued the piece in the three jaw chuck:

Made the piece flat on both ends and then turned down to dimension, truing after taking it out of the chuck each time:

Drilled the holes with the use of the diving head:

Drilled the rear (clearance) holes, ready to work on the front on Tuesday.

## Tuesday
Drilled front holes, starting from smallest 0.5 mm to largest 4.5 mm:

Next I milled the clearance for the middle holes on the back, this time using the dividing head free-hand (as opposed to indexing it for the holes previously):

Lastly, I made the front and back flat on sandpaper, then green 3M paper, straight-grained until all marks are removed:

After that I worked with the DTI and green, yellow, and finally pink 3M papers to get the deviation in the surface to a minimum. I managed a deviation of ±0.005 mm, resulting in a polished surface:

## Wednesday, Thursday & Friday
For the rest of the week I worked on winding stems. The three I made (plus one I finished off from last week) all bent at different points after bluing.

The one from last week I bent during hub turning, after turning a very good slot. On it I practiced square lapping with 28 micron, then 14 micron paste. Tried turning hub whilst the stem is bent, but this does not bring good results.

On the first new stem this week I went under and bent it whilst cutting the chamfer on the square -- probably because I was turning the hand wheel too slow and the tool grabbed.

On the second stem I accidentally put the thread on the wrong end. The drawings we receive are of the W-01 but with the dimensions changed, and so are not to scale -- this caught me out. This one I bent whilst cutting the slot. Reason: tool rest too far away from the work. The tool rest needs to be placed closer as the slot gets smaller in diameter.

On the third stem, last thing Friday, I got the best M1 thread so far (with only one chipped tooth -- because of going too fast in that one area). For this one I took my time and went slow. Whilst threading, I went very very slowly back and forth. The tolerances were all spot on on this one. I bent it whilst turning the front part of the hub. Reasons: possibly needed to adjust tool rest closer to work; started turning eccentric (oval) and the graver grabbed the thick dip; and possibly turning the hand wheel too slowly. The main reason was turning eccentric which might have been because the work was not placed tightly enough in between centers.

We have a mock winding stem exam next Wednesday.

## Weekly Reading
> In view of the extraordinary nature of these revelations, to stop me from getting too proud I was given a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan to beat me and stop me from getting too proud! About this thing, I have pleaded with the Lord three times for it to leave me, but he has said, ‘My grace is enough for you: my power is at its best in weakness.’ So I shall be very happy to make my weaknesses my special boast so that the power of Christ may stay over me, and that is why I am quite content with my weaknesses, and with insults, hardships, persecutions, and the agonies I go through for Christ’s sake. For it is when I am weak that I am strong.
