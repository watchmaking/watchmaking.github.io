excerpt: This week mostly theory on the concept of time, reading measurements and technical drawings, marking out materials, and sawing. We disassembled and assembled the automatic works and calendar mechanism of the ETA 2824-2 and had a small theory test on Friday.

## Tuesday
Revision and research for a small test on Friday. Reading included "The Concept of Time" chapter from *Theory of Horology* as well as all micromechanics and manual technique topics we covered so far. Research included phases of the moon, time zones, international date line, and SI units.

Further, we covered two topics: reading measurements (from micrometers, vernier, gauges, etc.) and [reading technical drawings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8fAF0xMxBs).

## Wednesday
Disassembly and assembly of automatic works and calendar mechanism of the ETA 2824-2.

Presentation on [marking out materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2QT2C5larE) using scribes, squares, dividers, centre punches, protractors, [height gauges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height_gauge), and marking ink.

## Thursday
At home encasing of ETA 6498 which included attaching dial and hands, encasing the movement, closing case back and bezel with attention to gaskets. Not ideal as we didn't have a case press or hand pressing tool. We will be covering encasing in much more depth once back in school.

Presentation of sawing using a [hacksaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacksaw) and [piercing saw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercing_saw), with attention paid to safety, cutting action, blade fitting, saw teeth, sawing techniques, work support, and a primer on materials (brass, steel, heat-treated steel).

## Friday
Short test on our [standard calendar system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar), [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time), the [International Date Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Date_Line), micrometer reading, [moon phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase), units of measurement, direct/indirect measurement tools, cutting action of a hacksaw, decimal places in units of measure, and the [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system).
