## Monday
Improving my graver sharpening skills and technique: achieving better flatness and symmetry of diamond shape. The key is to hold the graver as hard as possible, and press it down hard also, locking the wrist and working from the elbow. Hold it as hard as you can, until you can't feel the tips of your fingers.

Continued turning practice: better diameter dimensions, 90 degree tip, shoulders need work.

## Tuesday
Slotting graver sharpening all day, and some practice at the end of the day.

## Wednesday
More slotting graver practice and re-sharpening to get it to cut smoothly.

More practice in 5mm diameter steel, and improving sharpening gravers.

## Thursday
Demo of filing square on winding stem in the lathe using roller support. Dressing file specific for this purpose.

Milled dynamic poising support. Needs bevelling.

## Friday
All day project watch work. Finished the yoke with bevelling and straight graining.

Completed two setting wheels with circular graining. Need to wait to finish the canon pinion and hour wheel to see what height they should be. Practiced black polishing on the canon pinion tip (3M papers: green, grey, pink, white -- worked great).

Made a custom punch on the lathe, hardened. Tried hammered effect finishing on a scrap main plate. First brushed the surface by hand with green paper, and then hammered away. The finishing needs some more practice: need more consistent pressure, and more concentrated hits. Might have some issues with the main plate flexing and bending, especially around the thinner areas such as the barrel recess.
