## Tuesday
Filed dynamic poising support to tolerance, square, and flat.

Finished the sawing support project to tolerance with final surface finish. The stock was in quite a rough condition with deep marks. This will be taken into account when the tutor marks this piece.

I planned the anvil and pusher box lid for the exam next week. We cut the stock, and discussed how the legs will be pushed in with a staking tool. This week we'll make practice pieces of this to be read for the 8 hour exam next Wednesday.

I will be reworking the keyless works in the ETA 6498-based project watch. For this I needed a technique for cutting out components such as the click spring and springs in general. I thought I'd have to resort to filing all of it to shape by hand but the tutor recommended a book which describes the grinding technique. This is: a rotating grinding disk is attached to a lathe, with a support, the piece is held flat and ground to shape.

Discussed the dial side of the project watch with the tutor: keyless works and chapter ring. I showed my [keyless works drafting post](/student-blog/project-watch-keyless-works-drafting) I did over the weekend.

## Wednesday
Discussed the difference between the tourbillon and the carrousel (or karussel) with the tutor. We watched these videos on the topic:
 - [Blancpain Tourbillon vs. Carrousel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FzXOeSTahU)
 - [Summary: BLANCPAIN - the difference between a tourbillon and a carrousel explained by Jeff Kingston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjHwFJATAzk)
 - [The Art of Tourbillon & Carrousel in Watchmaking â€“ Chronometry Saga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f82wjlU30Gg)

Continued filing the anvil box lid. At lunch, I relaxed (heated to cherry red and let it cool off by itself) the setting lever jumper and filed it roughly to shape.

I made a big nick in the lower part of the jumper itself but now I know that filing it to shape doesn't take too long, just need a good way of holding it. In my case it was in the jaws of a steel vice. Later that week I covered the steel jaws with a thin sheet of brass and hammered it to shape to protect any future work.

We got results for our marked sawing support project. I got joint highest in class: 93%. I lost marks on the edges in the "V" cutout and corners in two other spots.

## Thursday
Finished the practice anvil box lid piece. Filed to size, drilled, and pushed in the legs.

Tried hardening the setting lever jumper prototype, bound in iron wire. It broke at the area where I made the accidental nick. Next step is to make two steel plates that screw together, which will hold the piece flat during hardening.

## Friday
Completed another anvil and pusher box lid from start to finish. Much more confident for the exam. I'll be making a step-by-step plan for the exam over the weekend.

I started planning the steps I'll need to look at for the project watch. Each component that needs work is listed, with statuses for each and the next steps. We haven't worked on the lathes yet, so I marked which step requires a lathe and which doesn't. All self explanatory. Still a work in progress.
