## Monday
More servicing practice with focus on keyless works lubrication. To improve dexterity, I also serviced a ladies AS 1977-1 movement. First go at oiling was messy with such tiny jewels.

Couldn't perfect the beat error as I think there was something wrong with the hairspring. The timekeeping was okay for a calibre of this size and age.

Ended the day by tapping one of the nuts for the bolt tool. I held this in the Schaublin and turned the work by hand slowly.

## Tuesday
Focused on adjusting barrel end shake in the morning.

Rest of the day was micro-mechanics: tapped the rest of the nuts and handles for the bolt tool.

Threaded the bolt tool legs in the Schaublin, cut off the remainder, filed both ends flat, hardened, cleaned the residue using fibre pen, cleaned in ultra sonic tank and dried, and finally blued.

## Wednesday
Longer morning demonstration and practice of checking and adjusting end shakes in the gear train and escapement.

Looked at wheel and pinion divisions where the aim is for the wheels to mesh right in the middle of the corresponding pinions.

In the afternoon I attached the bolt tool legs to their handles using green Loctite and a pin vice. At the end, I bevelled lightly the handles on top in the Schaublin using sand paper.

## Thursday
Adjusting ETACHRON presentation and practice. Below is a fully serviced watch with pins "open" versus pins closed. Notice the difference in positions where the hairspring changes position dramatically because the pins aren't closed.

Continued work on the bolt tool: milled 45 degree slots to hold various size screws.

Removed burrs and straight-grained throughout; finishing the bolt tool project before Easter.

Ended the day by testing out the pantograver by engraving this Latin phrase on my file cleaner.

Clean up, and Easter break until the 12th.
