We ground the tungsten gravers on the honing wheel. At some point I broke the tip of mine and had to re-sharpen.

Started working on the dummy winding stem.

## Wednesday
Winding stem threading, hardening and tempering demonstration. Continued on dummy winding stem, improving tungsten graver use.

Had a look at a watch with a Omega Co-Axial 8500 movement under the microscope.

Turned most of my first W-01 winding stem.

Threaded, filed the square, and hardened the stem -- leaving bluing, slot cutting, and pivot turning for next week.

## Site Updates
In the [Guides](/guides) section of the site, I added four new guides which contain a total of seven selected chapters from the *Rule of Saint Benedict* -- a book of precepts written in 516 by Benedict of Nursia for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot. The spirit of Saint Benedict's Rule is summed up in the motto of the Benedictine Confederation: pax ("peace") and the traditional ora et labora ("pray and work"). It contains the Truth applicable to all and will be an indispensable resource to the reader.

## Weekly Readings
*I will plant a shoot on the high mountain of Israel*.
> The Lord says this:
>
> ‘From the top of the cedar,<br>
> from the highest branch I will take a shoot<br>
> and plant it myself on a very high mountain.<br>
> I will plant it on the high mountain of Israel.<br>
> It will sprout branches and bear fruit,<br>
> and become a noble cedar.<br>
> Every kind of bird will live beneath it,<br>
> every winged creature rest in the shade of its branches.<br>

> who stunts tall trees and makes the low ones grow,<br>

*The kingdom of God is a mustard seed growing into the biggest shrub of all*.
> Jesus said to the crowds: ‘This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man throws seed on the land. Night and day, while he sleeps, when he is awake, the seed is sprouting and growing; how, he does not know. Of its own accord the land produces first the shoot, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. And when the crop is ready, he loses no time: he starts to reap because the harvest has come.’
>
> He also said, ‘What can we say the kingdom of God is like? What parable can we find for it? It is like a mustard seed which at the time of its sowing in the soil is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; yet once it is sown it grows into the biggest shrub of them all and puts out big branches so that the birds of the air can shelter in its shade.’
>
> Using many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, so far as they were capable of understanding it. He would not speak to them except in parables, but he explained everything to his disciples when they were alone.
>
> <cite>Mark 4:26-34</cite>
