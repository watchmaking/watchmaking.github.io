> To sum up: Banish damp, dirt, draughts and distraction. Encourage comfort, warmth, quiet. Provide good light, good ventilation, good tools and a liberal supply of materials. Good and *profitable* work should result.
>
> Although I am going to describe working conditions of an ideal character, it does not prevent the beginner from making a start in a simple way. **But do not think that any good can come of trying to do work on the corner of an odd table. Take the job seriously** and at least fit up a shelf to serve as a bench.

Soon after deciding that watchmaking is what I wanted to devote my time to, I started buying tools and setting up a temporary work space. I followed de Carle's advice and took the job seriously: I made a portable watchmaker's work bench to place on top of my regular desk. I decided on going the DIY route for three reasons: the cost of buying a ready-made bench was too high (*see Horotec or Bergeon portable benches*); I could make the bench with custom dimensions so that it fit in my environment; and I had the satisfaction of making something myself based on a design and material of my choice.

My design is basically a box without a bottom. Through this simple design I saved a lot of money compared to buying a ready-made bench. Sure: my design doesn't have arm rests. But as I said, it is temporary and provides sufficient utility. It is similar to the benches in Roger W. Smith's workshop, but more adapted for my limited desk space:

## Prerequisites
I chose American Oak timber for the sides (purchased from a local DIY store) and an off-cut of generic oak from eBay for the top. First find the top that fits your specification and buy the timber for the sides to fit. Ensure sufficient height of the sides. The total height of the bench is about 215mm which, when placed on my desk, makes it 955mm from the floor. Calculate the ideal height of the bench based on your own height, the location where you'll place it, and on how low your chair goes. Donald de Carle suggests 36 to 38 inches from the floor (that is 91.44cm to 96.52cm). Ensure the top provides sufficient length to rest the elbows while at work.

I chose oak because of its rigidity and hardness. This meant sawing it was quite difficult as it is such a dense wood. The result however, was satisfying as the bench is very solid and heavy. It will no doubt last for a long time.

The timber I chose for the sides was not completely flat and I did not have the tools to plane it. I still constructed the bench, but any gaps I filled with multi-purpose wood filler. I did not use any special joints. I attached everything with wood adhesive, screws, and inside I used right-angled corner mounting brackets with screws. On the screw slots I used a countersink drill bit so that the heads were flush (or slightly more than flush so that they could be filled with wood filler).

I sanded everything by hand using sandpaper wrapped around a cork sanding block. I focused most on the top surface to give it a very smooth almost glossy finish. I used yacht varnish on all sides except the top which I wanted to keep raw. After the varnish dried, I mounted on a self-adhesive Bergeon 6808-B work mat.

## 3D model
The below model is an approximation of what I constructed, with some improvement which I did not have the chance to implement (namely, wooden right-angled corner mounting brackets instead of plastic ones I used, and increased edge curves on the work-top).

You may use the "Measure" tool to get all the measurements. Use the "Explode Model" slider to see all the different parts.
