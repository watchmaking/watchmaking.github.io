The first rule of the regulations governing the Genevan Corporation of Watchmakers craft guild, reviewed and approved in council on 19 January 1601, is:

> All the assembled master watchmakers will be obligated to pray to God, asking His Presence within their midst, so that they would only say or do only those things that would honor God and benefit the City.

## "A Call to Prayer"
Although a little rough around the edges in regards to the details of the Christian tradition, giving way to some inaccurate generalizations, the quoted parts presented here nevertheless give a well-rounded and fair historical overview of horology in the Christian world setting.

![On seven depictions this wall charts shows a medieval monastery and the different tasks of monastic life. In the center of the wall chart you can see the big picture of a monastery complex: the church, a cloistered courtyard as well as the refectory, the dormitory, the chapter house and the necessarium). Monks are working in the woods and on the fields surrounding the monastery. On the small depictions monastic life is shown by pictures showing worship and prayer (2), education in a local school (3), hospitality (4), studying the scripture and copying manuscripts (5), pastoral care (6) and maintenance works (7). The wall chart probably shows the oldest European Benedictine monastery in the form it had in the 12th century. The development of towns and universities changed the feudal system which formerly collaborated with the monasteries.](/images/student-blog/monastic-life-12th-century.jpg)

Selections from the first chapter, *A Call to Prayer*, describing the monastic influence on the development of timekeeping and alarm devices:

> A faint peal of the bells from the monastery atop a distant hill reminded the faithful that it was time for prayer. Within the highly regulated medieval community of the monastery, the brothers, lay brothers and servants were busy everywhere. They lived and worked to the bells that called them to a daily regimen of prayer and ceremony, work and meditation. Time was of the essence because time belonged to God and it could not be wasted.
>
> The monastery ran by strict rules and an unerring schedule. It was the duty of those in the monastery to pray, and to pray often, in order to save the multitude of faithful outside the monastery, whose worldly duties kept them from devoting their full time to the service of God. Their praying took the form of seven daytime services, called *[canonical hours](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_hours)*, because they were recited at specified times, and one at night called the *vigil*. Organized around these "hours" were times for individual prayer, study and the other activities of cloistered life.
>
> To the Christian, simultaneous group prayer was considered the most powerful form of prayer. Time discipline was taken seriously in the monastery, and nothing was so important as the punctual, collective prayer, chanted aloud. It was not acceptable to be late for prayer. To the Christian community, the whole was greater than the sum of the individual parts.
>
> The Christian was different from adherents of the other religions that worshiped the same God. The Judaic worshiper is obligated to pray three times a day, but not at specific times: in the morning after the sun comes up; in the afternoon before sunset; and in the evening after dark. Nature gave the pious Jew the signals to pray—no timepiece or alarm was needed.
>
> Islam calls for five daily prayers: at dawn (just before sunrise); just after noon when the sun is highest; sometime in the afternoon before sunset; just after sunset; and then after dark. Here again, nature gives the signals for prayer. In both Judaism and Islam, local religious leaders could set times for prayer, but these times were not absolute.
>
> Offering daily prayers the requisite three or five times was absolutely necessary, but great leeway was given for when they were offered. After all, in both Islam and Judaism, prayer is a personal act and (with some exceptions) need not be carried out as part of a group.
>
> Christianity, especially that practiced in the monasteries, was different. The early Christians had no standard liturgy, they were not yet even a Church. But, since most of the originators of Christianity were Jews, they used the practices of the older faith to build their own. They accepted the morning and evening prayers "when you lie down and when you rise" (Deuteronomy 6:7), and the three daily prayers called for by Daniel, when he got "down on his knees three times a day to pray to his God and praise him" (Daniel 6:10). And they added additional times, making eight in all, in order to distinguish themselves from the Hebrew practitioners of the faith. As the Christian Church developed, these times of prayer became a part of the Church canon of law and divided the day into canonical hours around which all other activities were organized. The apostle Paul taught that the faithful should be in a state of continual prayer ([1 Thessalonians 5:16-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16-18&version=NRSV), [Ephesians 6:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A18&version=NRSV)). By virtue of their calling, the monks were in a perpetual state of communion with God, no matter what they were doing: they made no distinction between work and prayer. To them work was prayer (see *[ora et labora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pray_and_work)*).

## "Orderliness and Measured Time"
> To become organized and stay organized, the monasteries measured time. The ringing of bells alerted the cloistered community to the daily activities, calling them to prayer, to study, to work, to sleep—big bells and little bells, each with its own meaning. For hundreds of years the hourglass, clepsydra and the calibrated burning lamp were the instruments used to remind the bell-ringers when to signal the next event. To adjust for the changing daylight and nighttime hours, the clerics carefully measured and proportioned the time, calculating the length of each night and day for every day of the year, measuring to the nearest quarter-hour or so because the time-measuring devices were no more accurate than this.
>
> Time mattered to the monks because being late for the all-important prayer was stealing time away from God; and sleeping through the nighttime vigil could have serious consequences. The apostle Matthew admonished the faithful that the Lord would come at an hour when they would not expect him ([Matthew 24:42-44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A42-44&version=NRSV)). And Luke added that "if he comes in the second watch, or in the third" blessed are the servants who are watching for the Second Coming of the Lord. Woe be, then, to the poor bell-ringer who failed to awaken his brethren for the nighttime vigil!

## "Automating the Ringing Bell"
> It was for the potentially hapless nighttime bell-ringer that the mechanical alarm developed. Akin to our baking timer, the alarm timer would run for hours, tripping an alarm at the appointed time and awakening the bell-ringer who would then ring the vigil bell for the rest of the monastery. These devices were not clocks in our sense of the term. They did not record the time or run continuously. They were timers.
>
> The alarm timer that woke the bell-ringer evolved in the twelfth century into a mechanism that actually rang the bell, using a series of gear wheels that were driven or powered by a falling weight. The gears would turn a ratcheting lever that clamored against the bell. A clepsydra would determine when to release the bell-ringing mechanism. This clepsydra-controlled automated bell was ideal on a small scale, but to ring the bells on a large scale—the big bell in the monastery tower, for instance—required a different controller. It was not practical to bring water up into a tower to feed the clepsydra that controlled the large automated bells.

> Inventive clerics and blacksmiths put their minds together and, in the thirteenth century, the true mechanical clock emerged—unique to Europe. Other countries had their sundials and clepsydras, but only Europe had the mechanical clock. Using the weight-driven gear wheels of the alarm mechanism, these creative geniuses realized that the back-and-forth motion of the bell-ringer could be used to control the speed of the gears. By placing small weights on both ends of the ringing lever, they made a speed governor that released the Power of the weight-driven gear wheels at a relatively constant rate. The last wheel in the gear train is the *crown wheel* (so named because it looks like a crown). Its pointed tips, which were blocked and released by pallets on the axle of the oscillating lever, gave a back-and-forth motion to this oscillating lever arm. The pallets on the axle were called the [*verge*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verge_escapement), and the crown wheel was called the *escape wheel*, because this wheel allowed the rotating motion of the gear train to "escape" one tooth at a time. The speed of the escaping teeth was governed by the length of the lever arm, called a *foliot*, because it seemed to have a mad motion as it moved back and forth (from the Old French *fol*= mad.)
>
> By moving the weights on the ends of the foliot, the rate of its oscillation could be changed—up or down—to bring the speed of the escaping wheels into some standard, measurable rate. The standard would be the time from sunrise to sunrise. By adding the correct ratio of gear wheels, the clockmaker could produce a series of gears, one of which would turn every 12 hours. With a lever on that wheel, it could ring a bell twice a day, and an indicator hand on the wheel would give you a clock to record and measure time. For a long time the hand was not there. The clock simply struck the bells and you knew that it was time for prayer or work or sleep by the number and sound of the bells.
