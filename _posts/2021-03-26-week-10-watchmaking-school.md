## Monday
We started the day with stripping down a ETA 6498-1, placing it mesh cleaning baskets and using the Elma cleaning machine to clean all the parts. Afterwards, we got a presentation on cleaning and on lubrication.

## Tuesday
Step by step lubrication demonstration whilst we follow along on the 6498.

First, practiced oiling the balance end cap jewels. Below is an example of one with slightly too little oil:

Then we moved onto the train bridge jewels.

Before assembling and oiling the escapement we treated the escape wheel with a surface tensioner called Epilam (or Fixodrop). The escape wheel was put into a pea basket, put into this special jar and turned upside down for a few minutes. Then, swiftly, it was taken out and dried with a hair drier to dry it and also "bake" it.

The pallet jewels were treated differently: using a pipette, only the jewels themselves were submerged inside the Epilam solution, and then dried and baked with a hair drier (with caution: as if heated too much the shellac holding the pallets might melt).

We then moved onto oiling the escapement using this method: with the balance taken out, a light wind in the barrel, under the microscope, apply oil to the escape wheel tooth, using a peg move the pallet fork twice, apply again, and do this until you see the firstly oiled tooth at the top. Run through a few times and check the amount applied. The microscope was very useful for this, just need to get used to the depth of vision.

After oiling everything else, we placed the movements on the Witschi Watch Expert III timing machine and had a go at adjusting the beat error and timing. At the end of the day I got my movement within decent tolerances (not the image below).

During my break, I looked at a 1998 Blancpain under our Leica S4E microscope:

## Wednesday
Further servicing practice -- began work on two ETA 6498-1 calibres and one 6498 clone. Learned to wind mainsprings using Bergeon mainspring winders. Used the Elmasolvex VA (below) for cleaning. We also have access to the Greiner Vibrograf ACS900.

## Thursday
More servicing two ETA 6498-1 movements at the same time. Finished oiling the ETA clone and left it until we cover hairsprings as it needs its pinned. The tutor went through one of my oiled movements as if he were marking my work -- very useful, I knew where I oiled to little or too much, etc.

Restarted work on bolt tool handles.

## Friday
Continued work on bolt tool handles and finished them -- only tapping left.

Servicing practice on the ETA 6498-1 movements, as well as a ladies A. Schild movement to improve dexterity and oiling precision.
