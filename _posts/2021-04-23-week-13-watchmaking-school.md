## Monday
Finished drilling anvil and pusher box base.

Continued practicing black polishing. I tried cutting down on the number of steps of papers and pastes I used, so now to black polish I use: blue 3M (9 micron), pink 3M (3 micron), 1.5 micron paste, 0.5 micron paste.

I got started on the flat brass lap and finished it first thing Tuesday.

## Tuesday
The brass scraper tool with a 30 degree angle was difficult at first. To get the angle right was tricky. It took me all of Tuesday and beginning of Wednesday to get it complete.

## Wednesday
Some theory and demo today. We learned about hardening and tempering, surface finish principles, grinding and sharpening principles.

I started the steel 3 sided cutter/scriber. The scriber part needed to be 30 degrees and was reasonably easy to achieve -- I did this last. The 3 sided cutter part was harder and I needed to start again. The key was to mark out an equilateral triangle on a flat face and file equally on all three sides until you got a point. Then it is a matter of ensuring flatness, removal of facets, and centering of the sharp point tip itself.

A method I learned in a book was to use french chalk on the files in order to avoid clogging. The file is run across a french chalk block. The method worked well and clogging was reduced and the cutting was smoother.

## Thursday
I finished the 3 sided cutter/scriber in the morning.

I then hardened, polished, and tempered the tool to a blue color. I applied polishing tape to the ends of the blued surface and polished so that the blued ends were even.

Began work on the brass sawing support by milling and drilling the two holes. The countersinking tool was damaged so I will have to wait until next week to finish this tool.

Went golfing after school.

## Friday
Got an overview of the MyRolex World Service website: 3D manuals, technical drawing and guides, ordering parts, etc. Very interesting website -- well organised and clear.

We were introduced to the brass cube project which we'll start next week. This is a brass cube, 15x15x15mm with Â±0.05mm tolerance.

Had some spare time, so I milled, drilled, and finished a screw bluing plate.
