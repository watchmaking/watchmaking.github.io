## Monday
We began the week by sharpening gravers. First, we polished about 15mm of the cutting side of the graver on an Arkansas stone, ready for sharpening the diamond shapes later this week.

## Tuesday & Wednesday
We began sharpening the diamond side of the gravers on India stones and then polishing on Arkansas stone. This is by far the most tedious part of the course so far. You need to hold the graver very tightly in your fingers, lock your wrist, and move from your elbow only. All this is required to have a symmetrical, flat, and correctly angled diamond face.

We finished sharpening most of the gravers on Wednesday and started practicing turning in brass.

## Thursday
More practice turning in brass. I turned three component holders tools for my project watch, used for graining:
 - I, setting wheels
 - II, hour wheel
 - III, minute wheel
 - IIII, canon pinion tip
 - IIIII, crown wheel

The tools are marked with corresponding dashes to know which one is which. The components friction fit onto the rods, and are rotated in the lathe. A polishing compound such as green 3M paper on peg wood is pressed onto the component, and a circular graining is applied.

After lunch, we moved onto turning in steel. This has a very different feeling to brass, and blunts the gravers a lot quicker, requiring sharpening and polishing more often.

## Friday
We continued practicing turning in steel, this time focusing on turning to dimension shoulders and points.

We finished the day by installing new Waldmann Taneo LED bench lamps, working on project watch designs, and discussing the moral implications of the story portrayed in the 1969 film *Kes*.

## Project Watch: Setting Lever Jumper Jig
Whilst working on the setting lever jumper this week, I broke off the jumper arm during polishing on grey 3M paper when removing black soot after hardening. I need to start again on this. This time, I will make a simple polishing jig for holding this component. So far, I used my finger to hold the component flat, resulting in uneven polishing and eventually a broken jumper arm.

The part will be secured by a screw, and four posts: two large for the body, and two small for keeping the jumper arm still. The aim is to have a way of holding the component flat during polishing and at the end, straight graining.

I'll focus on finishing the yoke next week, and making the jig. I'm able to do a lot more now, that we have access to our 8mm lathes. I'll practice circular graining the motion work wheels, and possibly finishing some of them at the end of the week.
