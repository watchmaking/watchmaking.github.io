excerpt: Short notes about the last week of remote watchmaking school, before we get back into the building on Monday.

In this final week of remote learning we slowly ran out of material we could cover at home. If we had to continue remote watchmaking school we would have been sent the ETA 7751 early. Fortunately, next week we can get into the building.

On Monday we discussed the power reserve complication for someone else's personal project, then had a look at the ETA 955.112 keyless work to clear up any issues with assembly, and finally for the rest of the day (and the week) we practiced sequential work.

## Sequential work
I've never come across this method before. Sequential work usually means working on a handful of movements of the same calibre at once, performing every operation on each in sequence. For example, the movements are each in a movement holder, and their parts are on a white piece of paper with black marker division drawn on. If we are assembling the barrel bridge, we assemble it for each watch before moving on to the next operation. This allows you to compare for example side-shake across the movements and saves you time having to go fetch spare parts if you need to replace the gaskets (which are usually always replaced).
