## Monday
Our first remote lesson was a run-through of all the tools we purchased as part of our toolkit, a guide on how to calibrate a caliper and a micrometer, and a look-through an ETA 2824-2 technical communication document.

### Calibration
As part of the toolkit we received a TESA CCMA-M 0.02 MM dial vernier caliper and a TESA ISOMASTER AA 0-25 external micrometer. Both came in a single black Bergeon-branded wooden box. We calibrated them roughly in the zero-position, that is without a reference gauge. If we were using a reference gauge we would need to ensure as far as possible, the temperature between the tool and reference gauge to be the same.

Before calibrating either of the measuring tools, ensure the measuring faces are clean of any dirt by squeezing a piece of clean white paper between the faces and sliding it out. You will see any dirt on the paper.

After cleaning the surfaces, to calibrate the vernier caliper unscrew lightly the bottom silver screw underneath the dial. Whilst the faces are touching in the zero-position, rotate the dial until it is pointing to exactly zero, and screw the silver screw all the way.

As with the caliper, carefully clean the measuring faces of the micrometer as well as the free part of the spindle. Close measuring faces while turning the spindle slowly and evenly using friction drive. Fix spindle with the aid of the locking lever.

For small deviations of reading on the micrometer, turn the barrel to the correct position by means of forwarded setting key. This requires quite a lot of force and grip.

In order to ensure reliable repeatability of the values, measurement should always be performed with the friction drive function.

### General remarks

Eye loupes tend to fog up depending on the temperature of the workshop and your body. A simple solution to this is drilling holes in the side of your loupe.

Sometimes brand-new eye loupes have rough edges from the plastic moulding. You can run the edges on an Arkansas stone to smooth them in order to avoid irritation around the eye.

Always put components under covers on your bench.

Black bench mats are good in particular for encasing as you can see lint, fibres, etc. on the dark background.

Regarding movement holders, always check all four sides are gripping the movement securely. Nicer quality holder like the Bergeon ones we have tend to have inward angled edges which grip the movement further down to avoid it popping up when pressure is applied. Plastic movement holders tend to wear out quicker than metal ones and also not grip as good.

## Tuesday
To practice measuring and filing, we next had to accurately measure three different (green 2mm, pink 1.6mm, red 1.2mm) Bergeon screwdriver blades, produce working drawings for each, and reproduce three of each from brass rods.

![Bergeon steel screwdriver blades we based ours on](/images/student-blog/bergeon-steel-screwdriver-blades.jpg)

We used brass rods, pin vices, a pillar file, a square file, and India and Arkansas stones for sharpening the blades themselves. For marking out I used a black felt tip, and marked lines in the ink using a caliper.

1. Cut the brass rod to the correct length using the square file;
2. File flat both ends and remove burrs;
3. Mark out the rear notch part;
4. Using the pillar file, file the rear notch whilst checking every so often to ensure the correct depth of the notch;
5. Ensure the notch has a downward taper from the rear so that the retaining screw in the screwdriver handle grips the blade;
6. Remove burrs, insert into screwdriver handle, and put the handle in the screwdriver sharpener;
7. Sharpen the blade on the India stone.

![Sharpening a screwdriver blade on an India stone](/images/student-blog/screwdriver-blade-sharpening-using-india-stone.jpg)

I found that with the non-Swiss screwdriver sharpener, I couldn't get the screwdriver handle past the grip (be it knurled or the black plastic kind) into the hole of the sharpener for handles 140 and up. This resulted in blade ends not having as long a taper as I'd like them to, however they are still technically functional.

If we attended an assessment day (which was done online this year), one of the tasks would have been to file a flat on a short brass rod and make it stand by itself on the desk. This is more difficult than it sounds, using only a pillar file and a pin vice.

## Wednesday
Next, we began disassembling the ETA 6498-1 movement whilst getting an overview of what the different components do and how they interact. First, we adjusted the screwdriver blades we made to fit the screws on the case and movement:

> The blades of the screwdrivers should receive constant attention. The business end must be shaped, not to a knife edge, but with an edge (...) The taper of the blade should be reasonably long so that when it is inserted in the slot of a screw it will not, when a little pressure is exerted either to unscrew or screw up, have the tendency to slip out of the slot and so maul the screw head.
>
> {% include cite_bib.html t="Practical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition" p="5" %}

![Correctly and incorrectly shaped screwdriver blade](/images/student-blog/correctly-and-incorrectly-shaped-screwdriver-blade.png)

> A carelessly used screwdriver can cause marks and scratches on the watch plates, and badly sharpened blades can damage the screw heads. The blade must be pressed firmly down into the screw-head slot before the screwdriver is rotated, and if increase in the turning pressure is necessary the downward pressure must be proportionally increased.
>
> The fit of the blade into the slot is important if the screwdriver is to be used deftly and with confidence. A correctly shaped blade fitting into a good slot is shown in Fig 21. Note that the flat edge of the blade does not reach the bottom of the slot and so cannot skid out sideways and the sides cannot mark the visible edge of the slot.

We were shown the correct procedure to remove the bezel of the case and the correct way of handling the different components with attention given to springs, etc.

## Thursday
We assembled the ETA 6498-1 movement again, however left the last step of casing until we come back to school. It became apparent that the ETA technical communication document for the movement doesn't always present the order of assembly in the actually correct order. We were told not to blindly follow the manual, but to think ahead. For example, the manual tells us to place the canon pinion and hour wheel in place, before we even assembled the centre wheel and its surrounding parts, etc. The manuals are very important for lubrication points, which means you should always have the most up-to-date version.

Though we haven't looked at inspection or fault identification at all yet, we talked about checking back-wind on the gear train:

> If the train is perfectly free and you allow it to run down after winding the mainspring a little, the train should reverse its motion at the very end of the mainspring. In other words, before the escape wheel stops it should run backwards for perhaps one revolution or two. This is due to the rebound when the eye of the mainspring butts on the hook of the barrel arbor. It is perhaps a crude test, but it forms a general indication that all is well with the freedom of the train.

We paid attention to screw identification which reminded me of Fried's "Various Types of Watch Screws" chapter:

> Simple as they are individually, the varied assortment of screws used in a watch are one of the most complex facets of the watchmakers' trade.
>
> One of the most paradoxical branches of watchmaking centers around watch screws. No universal agreement exists on thread size, pitch, design or thread direction.
>
> In one watch, one may find as many as four different kinds of bride screws, ratchet and crown wheel screws with different thread direction, cap and jewel screws of various thicknesses and lengths, some with polished heads, others with unpolished heads but polished thread ends and other differences.

## Friday
We covered theory of the keyless works, discussed personal project ideas, and got an overview of finishing techniques.

### Keyless works
> The first watches were wound and set by a separate loose key. A common arrangement was for the mainspring to be wound from the back and the hands set from the front.
>
> Using a key to wind and set a watch has numerous disadvantages: the key can get lost, the hole in the case back lets in dust, and the dial or hands can easily be damaged during setting.
>
> To overcome these problems mechanisms were invented that allowed the watch to be wound and set using a button or crown on the end of the pendant, the tube that projects from the side of the case and carries the bow.
>

One of the historical mechanisms we covered was the rocking bar system:

![Rocking bar system in a Longines movement](/images/student-blog/rocking-bar.jpg)

> The rocking bar mechanism, shown in the image here, uses a bar with with a central wheel that can be turned by turning the crown, and wheels mounted on both ends. The wheels on the ends engage with either the winding or setting mechanism, in the normal position the winding mode is engaged. The bar is rocked to change the mechanism from the winding to hand setting mode.

We also discussed the negative set system which is well described in [this article](https://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/watchmovement.php#negset).

Finally, we discussed the modern style keyless works, described in the following books:

{% include cite_bib.html t="The Watch Repairer's Manual, 2nd edition" p="15—17 ('The Dial Train', 'The Setting Mechanism')" %}

The terminology WOSTEP requires us to use is the one found in ETA technical communication documents:

![Keyless winding mechanism](/images/student-blog/keyless-winding-mechanism.png)

### Finishing techniques
The finishing techniques we will be required to complete and be assessed on are (in suggested order of completion): sand/bead blasting, circular graining/spinning, dressing flanks, straight graining, cutting countersinks, polishing countersinks, perlage/spotting, frosting, Côtes de Genève, pin stripes, bevelling, snailing, black polishing, bluing, pantograve.
