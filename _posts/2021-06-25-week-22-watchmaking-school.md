## Monday
Completed the barrel closer tool in plastic on the Schaublin:

Got marked by the tutor on my first unbroken winding stem: 70% grade.

Practiced square chamfer cutting with slotting tool.

## Tuesday
I looked up dimensions for a Garrard ETA 1120 movement which has a missing winding stem. I used the school's vintage Ronda book:

The booklet doesn't provide some length values. These need to be measured by hand inside the movement. I'll make a winding stem for it later on in the course.

When filing the square on the winding stem, it is important to keep the file clean. I clean it with honing oil on paper, then with a brass file cleaner, and then run it on some white chalk (this avoids clogging). Giving the file a clean between each square gives the best results.

I experimented with bluing, to get the color more consistent. I used larger brass filings which were also fresh. The filings should be less compressed than the dust ones, and bright in color (not burnt up). This is an example of brass filings for bluing that gave me a consistent color:

These are poor and useless:

The result was consistent:

Improved my pivot turning on the stem, but didn't follow my own steps and tried chamfering the square before turning the pivot to final dimension. I went under and bent the pivot.

## Wednesday
Made a brass square lapping tool. Tried yellow paper on it (too shiny finish), green paper (rounds the surface), and 20 micron blue paste which gave the best results.

Turned points on blanks for my next practice stems.

## Thursday
Completed another winding stem in approximately 4 hrs 30 mins. It works in the watch but is quite out of tolerance.

After hardening (without soap), in order to remove the black soot on the stem, we use a fiber scratch brash. I found that using circular motion on it gives a better result than straight strokes.

I need to improve my square filing: I need to work slower on it, think about the finish more, and leave it slightly oversized to allow for lapping later on.

Turned points for the rest of the day for a new winding stem drawing. This drawing is more similar to what we'll get in the exam, which means we'll start with 2 mm stock instead of 1.6 mm like we've been working now.

## Friday
Two false starts on the new winding stem: calculated and wrote down incorrect numbers on the diagram. Got as far as wrapping the stem in iron wire, ready for heat treatment next week.

## Weekly Readings
> You always have the most of everything – of faith, of eloquence, of understanding, of keenness for any cause, and the biggest share of our affection – so we expect you to put the most into this work of mercy too. Remember how generous the Lord Jesus was: he was rich, but he became poor for your sake, to make you rich out of his poverty. This does not mean that to give relief to others you ought to make things difficult for yourselves: it is a question of balancing what happens to be your surplus now against their present need, and one day they may have something to spare that will supply your own need. That is how we strike a balance: as scripture says: *The man who gathered much had none too much, the man who gathered little did not go short.*
