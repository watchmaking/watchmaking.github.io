More in-depth discussion of project watch ideas today.

I want to approach the project in a structured and almost modular way. That is: focus on the most important parts first and work towards the less important. For example, I would focus on the finishing of the dial side first, before moving onto the movement side. If for some reason I'm not able to finish the movement side I can always install a solid case back, etc.

The movement I will be working off of is the ETA 6498-1.

## Plating
The entire brass movement will have a rose gold plating, that is: base plate, three-quarter plate, balance cock, pallet bridge.

## Dial side
### Design
Open dial design showing the base plate directly, with a brushed steel chapter ring for the hour/minute track with drilled dots for each index. Blued arrow hands similar to Greubel Forsey Hand Made 1.

Finished with hammered effect throughout, with spotted surfaces in recesses for keyless and motion works. Countersunk and polished all jewel and inspection holes.

### Features
Reworked keyless works to include traditional yoke spring and aesthetically improved setting lever jumper.

No complications at this time. I prefer to focus on finishing and improving the movement to use more traditional solutions rather than flimsy click and yoke springs for example.

Sub-seconds display omitted.

Note the design of the keyless work in the Akrivia AK-06 and Roger W. Smith Series 2 Open Dial wristwatches above.

Blued arrow hands as per above.

## Movement side
### Design
Frosted and bevelled bridges, with thick polished countersinks, black polished screws (with bevelled sides and slot), snailed crown and ratchet wheels. Three-quarter plate design. Movement side base plate spotted. Bevelled and straight grained pallet bridge.

### Features
Three-quarter plate with traditional click spring.

#### Click spring
Today, we discussed the click spring in more depth. Some of the designs we discussed include the WOSTEP W-01 and Garrick S1.

Click spring and keyless work design needs further research.

### Inspiration
Finishing and three-quarter plate design are directly inspired by the Lange 1815 Thin Honeygold:

## Summary
The goal is a well finished and aesthetically balanced piece. I'd rather do simple work well than complicated work badly.
