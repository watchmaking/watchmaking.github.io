## Monday
Finished filing the bolt tool blank in the morning. Image looks wobbly, but the piece is as true and flat as is possible with only hand tools.

In the afternoon we got a demonstration of tapping holes.

Later I marked out the rear holes for the feet using a height gauge, ready for drilling and tapping tomorrow morning. The front holes need marking, drilling, and tapping this week as well.

## Tuesday
I drilled two rear holes, and two front blind holes on the bolt tool blank:
1. Center the drill on the previously marked points;
2. Using center drill, make center pips;
3. Using helix drill (diameter 2 mm), drill all the way through;
4. Using square-end milling drill (d. 2.5 mm) open up the two holes further.

The two front blind holes:
1. Use center drill on marked points;
2. Using helix drill (d. 2 mm), drill 6.5mm deep.

The rear holes I tapped.

I then gave it a light countersink to get rid of burrs.

In the afternoon, we got a demonstration of using the milling cutter to mill the two inner faces of the cut two-piece bolt tool. This I cut next, using a piercing saw.

We also set up a Leica microscope. I tested it on a Reverso.

## Wednesday
In the morning, I milled the two inner faces of the bolt tool using a 6 mm carbide square end mill, drilled two blind holes in the main body and tapped them. For drilling the two blind holes I used this sequence of steps:
1. Use 6 mm carbide square end mill to zero the work on the edge of the plate by zeroing as soon as the drill touched the sides (done in 0.1 mm increments until contact);
2. Use 3-sided cutter for center pips;
3. Use 1.6 mm carbide drill, drilling 6 mm deep.

The last step required a lot of patience and delicate touch. Drilling that deep with a very fragile carbide cutter requires you to drill very slowly and lightly, whilst pulling up the drill to let it cool and removing any swarf. A handful of drills of this kind broke inside other student's work, which is why I was extra careful.

Later I cut the side taper and filed the sides. I gave it a preliminary brushed finish.

The front piece I milled unknowingly to almost perfectly 5.00 mm as shown on the caliper.

## Thursday
Milled the front part of the bolt tool and hand-filed the angled sides of the main body.

We got a presentation of using the Schaublin 70 to hold our work whilst tapping a small round component (the lock nut and handle for the two rear height adjusters of the bolt tool). I started working on these adjuster parts from raw rod of brass. Filing flat and true a round rod of brass is very difficult.

## Friday
Further work on the locking nut and screw handle for the bolt tool legs. Filing and drilling. I found a better technique for filing the round rod of brass for the handles: lay file flat next to the side of a vice which makes a 90-degree angle; push the brass rod against the vice flat and drag across the file. This achieves a flat and true surface much quicker than what I was doing on Thursday.

We talked further about our personal project ideas and some career options.

Clean up, and early finish.
