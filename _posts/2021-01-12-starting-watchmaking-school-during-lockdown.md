excerpt: Watchmaking school was supposed to start this week, but due to the national lockdown measures we have to begin remotely. Here I describe initial toolkit contents and ways of how we're likely to proceed.

I was set to begin the 3000-hour WOSTEP course this week but due to strict state restrictions the school has closed until further notice. For the time being, we are planning on focusing on theory and basic movement disassembly at home. The [portable watchmaker's bench](/student-blog/diy-portable-watchmakers-bench) I made will be of much use.

## Remote learning toolkit contents
I have picked up the following list of toolkit items from the school in preparation for remote study starting next week. Some of the items seem to be available only for schools and cannot be bought online in the sets we got (e.g. set of tweezers of the kind described below). It appears that items with the code SPEC in their item number refer to non-standard Bergeon part numbers which are part of the WOSTEP toolkit.

 - Bergeon 30081-S09 turning stand with 9 screwdrivers;
 - Bergeon set of 8 tweezers and hairspring cutters in black wooden box: brass 74-22-PM-S5, superalloy AA 7028-2/4/5, plastic tip steel AA 6571-CFR-00 and 6571-D-SPEC, hairspring cutters 7027-15A, and steel angled AA 7026-6;
 - Bergeon 30026-A assortment of 5 round-headed pin vices in black wooden box;
 - Bergeon 66500-161-SPEC, 66500-174-SPEC, 66500-163-SPEC set of 3 magnifying loupes;
 - Bergeon 5461 set of 3 wire loupe holders;
 - Bergeon 4039 small movement holder;
 - Bergeon 4040 movement holder;
 - Bergeon 5394-P casing gel;
 - Bergeon 30019 pair of fine hand levers;
 - Bergeon 7404 set of 3 hand fitting tools;
 - Bergeon 30097-BC cover and tray with 6 compartments, unbreakable;
 - Bergeon 5733 bellows;
 - Bergeon 4125 Arkansas and India stones in black wooden box;
 - Bergeon 30451-150I 15cm steel ruler;
 - Bergeon 10725-SPEC Tesa 150mm Calipers, 0.02mm; 11360-SPEC Tesa ISO Master 0-25mm micrometer in black wooden box.

Not part of the official toolkit itself are some items we borrowed from school just for remote learning:

 - Bergeon 7808-N soft mat;
 - Generic screw driver sharpener;
 - White wide plastic tweezers;
 - Swiss case opening tool;
 - Bergeon 7033-1 premium Rodico;
 - Push hand remover tool;
 - Cannon pinion remover tool;
 - Plastic, thin round wooden, thick round wooden pegs;
 - Square needle file;
 - Flat needle file;
 - Tool tray;
 - Brass wire.

Additionally we received scrap and training movements sorted into three boxes:

### Quartz

 - Encased ETA white-dial watch with ETA 955-112 quartz movement;
 - ETA 955.112 quartz movement;
 - Tag Heuer ETA 955.112 quartz movement and red dial.

### Automatic

 - Encased ETA black-dial watch with ETA 2824-2 automatic movement;
 - Two Tissot ETA 2824-2 automatic movements.

### Manual

 - Two encased ETA white-dial watches with ETA 6498-2 manual movements.

Finally we received five service manuals for the following movements:

 - ETA 955.112 quartz;
 - ETA 6497-2 / 6498-2 manual;
 - ETA 2824-2 automatic;
 - ETA 2892A2 automatic;
 - ETA 7751 automatic chronograph with month, day, and moonphase.

The rest of the toolkit (larger tools and files, etc.) has been left at school.

## Proceeding
During a phone call with the school I was told that usually we'd start with the micro-mechanics module but due to the current situation, we will be focusing on theory and basic disassembly from home. The new format of the WOSTEP 3000-hour course coincides with the 1800-hour course so we will begin by covering the modules that both courses contain. I was told the course curriculum was re-written to be more up-to-date, as the previous curriculum was almost twenty years old.

## WOSTEP W-01
We spoke about the WOSTEP W-01 calibre. The W-01 is an ébauche movement which we will need to jewel, decorate, make a balance staff for, spring, and adjust. We have the possibility of sending the finished movement to Switzerland for COSC certification. If it passes the test we will receive case, dial, and hands from the school gratis to encase the watch and keep it. If it doesn't pass the certification it cannot leave the school without being encased — in this case we will need to pay for the case, dial, and hands ourselves. I've been told that sometimes students are disappointed because their movements don't pass the COSC tests even though they were well within the accuracy limits before being sent off by courier to Switzerland — in other words, we will need to rely on the delicacy of the courier.

## Personal project
During the call we discussed ideas for a personal project which I will be able to work on given I am not behind on the mandatory course work. I believe the project needs to be based on the ETA 6498 movement. At this stage, I expressed I want the project to be focusing on excellent finishing and one simple complication, namely the moonphase. I'd rather make a simple piece to the best of my abilities, than a complex piece badly.

I've composed an initial ideas collage (draft) containing some of the features I'd like my personal project to encompass. It is a little ambitious at the moment — I'll most likely get a better picture of what's possible with the tools we have and the time at our disposal.
