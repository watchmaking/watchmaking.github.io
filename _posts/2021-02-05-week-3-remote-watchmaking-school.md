excerpt: This week we started working on the ETA 2824-2 automatic calibre and covered the theory surrounding the gear train, gearing and transmission, shock systems, frequency, and hairspring vibrating. Earlier in the week we were shown service inspection points on the ETA 6498-1.

## Monday
Using the ETA 6498-1 for demonstration, we got an overview of how to perform a service inspection whilst disassembling a movement. Writing up a complete list of each individual inspection of every single component would be pointless. Instead, I summarised the inspection points as follows:
 - Perform initial timing machine test, this will show any obvious faults right away;
 - Check hairspring for flatness, deformations;
 - Check end-shake on all pivoted components (balance, pallet fork, gears);
 - Check pivots for smoothness, damage;
 - Check wear on acting/contact surfaces;
 - Check jewel damage, including pallet fork jewels for wear;
 - Check guard-pin is centred in safety roller;
 - Escapement: horn clearance, drop, run to banking, guard-pin clearance on both sides, notch condition, escape wheel height in relation to pallet jewel faces (should be in the middle);
 - Gear train: check gear-pinion meshing in vertical plane is central, check arbor uprightness, teeth profiles from side and top;
 - Barrel bridge area: check wheel and bridge wear, click wear, underside of crown wheel, check oil shadows;
 - Keyless works: sliding pinion Breguet teeth engagement and wear, setting mechanism tension, spring tension and condition, check posts, check bushes.

## Tuesday
We took a look at the arrangement, function, and adjustment of the gear train. End and side shakes of the wheel pivots was discussed and a Horia tool jewel adjustment demonstrated. When adjusting the gear train we need to take into account the following points:
 - End and side shake of barrel arbor, barrel complete, and all other wheels;
 - Check if all components are flat and true;
 - Teeth condition of all components;
 - Pivot condition of all components;
 - Jewel or bearing condition throughout the gear train.

Finally, we took a quick look at gear efficiency calculations and formulas for gear train revolutions.

## Wednesday
ETA 2824-2 automatic date calibre deconstruction (omitting complete automatic works and balance disassembly for now) in the morning and partial assembly of keyless and motion works in the afternoon.

### Exercises for the back and the eyes
We were sent two documents, WOSTEP-branded, noting posture and eye exercises to avoid tension and straining. Back exercises are as follows:
 - seated hip stretch;
 - shoulder shrugs;
 - upper back stretch;
 - spinal twist;
 - torso stretch;
 - forearm stretch;
 - neck stretch;
 - hip flexor stretch.

The above are usually held for 10-30 seconds (or 8-10 reps) and repeated for both sides (if applicable for the particular exercise). Eye exercises are similar to ones described in this article: [Eye Exercises by Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/eye-exercises).

## Thursday
Gearing and transmission presentation covering ratios, gear geometry (basic parts explained such as addendum, pitch circle, circular pitch, root, etc.), tooth forms ([involute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute_gear), [cycloidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid_gear), [epicycloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycloid), [hypocycloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocycloid)). The best chapter for this is found in Chapter 5 of *The Theory of Horology*:

Later, assembly of the ETA 2824-2 without automatic or calendar works in the morning. In the afternoon practice of disassembly and assembly of this calibre in order to get acquainted with the parts, architecture, screw identification, etc.

At the end of the call we discussed the [Vacheron Constantin Twin Beat](https://www.vacheron-constantin.com/en/manufacture/twin-beat.html) wristwatch. Very interesting concept:

Usually, when encountering a new calibre I aim to disassemble and assemble it nine times over a period of two or three days. During each disassembly you notice and learn something new. That's what I've done with the 6498 and will do the same with the 2824.

## Friday
Shock settings overview starting with a historical introduction to Breguet's [pare-chute](https://www.breguet.com/en/history/inventions/pare-chute) shock protection system invented in 1790; components of a shock setting; [common types](https://www.great-british-watch.co.uk/watch-anti-shock-settings/) (e.g. [Incabloc, Kif](https://www.bobinchak.com/watchmaking/2018/3/30/shock-protection-kif-vs-incabloc)); disassembly and assembly; and oiling.

Next, we covered the frequency of a movement, described in plenty of depth in the Regulating Organs chapter of *Theory of Horology*:

Springing was briefly covered and the Luthy tool was mentioned in relation to [vibrating hairsprings](https://watchmaking.weebly.com/hairspring-vibrating-tool.html). Vibrating the hairspring is something we'll [practice once back in school](https://www.bobinchak.com/watchmaking/2017/4/26/hairspring-week-vibrating-the-hairspring).
