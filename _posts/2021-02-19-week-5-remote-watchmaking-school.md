## Monday
At home ETA 2824-2 encasing. Again, not ideal as we lack a proper hand fitting press and case press.

## Tuesday
We disassembled both the ETA 6498 and ETA 2824-2, mixed up most of the parts (apart from bridges, balance, delicate or very heavy components) in our bell jar and proceeded to assemble them again. A good exercise for screw identification, but quite easy as the two movements are very different in size.

## Wednesday
We covered the [Swiss lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever_escapement) escapement in detail, and got quick overviews of the [Coaxial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_escapement) and [Pin-pallet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin-pallet_escapement) escapements.

Further, we practised some gear train calculations for working out vibrations per hour, various gear and pinion teeth counts and revolutions.

## Thursday
Short overview of the [Detent escapement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSNDjuKPdng). A dial and hands presentation was shown. For the rest of the day, we disassembled two ETA 2824-2 scrap movements, mixed them in a bell jar, and assembled them again.

## Friday
Brief overview of the [Anchor escapement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_escapement). Later we watched the [Super Factories: Breitling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaCgmeP1n2s) video followed by [Masters of Haute Horlogerie](https://www.hautehorlogerie.org/en/the-foundation/fhh-publications-and-dvds/dvd/) ([Part I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqcvPEd1SCs), [Part II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzMa2SzFKuw), [Part III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gUt4fX6Vts)) series.
