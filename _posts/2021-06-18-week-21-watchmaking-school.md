## Monday
Slotting graver tool grinding demonstration in tungsten. I made my own:

Broke my winding stem whilst trying to cut the slot.

## Winding Stem Exam
We went through the marking criteria for the 8 hour winding stem intermediate exam. We are marked on the following:

### Appearance, surface finish
 - Hubs must be cylindrical with consistent finish;
 - All shoulders must be 90 degree, sharper interior corners, with graver finish;
 - Bevel on front of square must be consistent 45 degree angle, with graver finish;
 - Flat surface of square must be true, flat, and consistent;
 - Centring of square to pivot is observed;
 - Slot must be 90 degrees, with sharp interior corners, with graver finish;
 - Thread must be consistently threaded, with peaks of threads not damaged or clipped, tempered blue finish;
 - All corners bevelled to 45 degree angle to remove burrs, not visible with naked eye.

### Dimensions and lengths
 - Pivot;
 - Square shaft, checked if taper is within tolerance;
 - Diagonal of square, to check if stock was turned to dimension;
 - Winding pinion step;
 - Inner hub;
 - Outer hub;
 - Slot;
 - Thread diameter.
 
The thread in the exam is pre-determined: M1. We also know the dimensions of the outer and inner hub, and the slot that will be in the exam. All other dimensions will be picked randomly by the examiner. The diameter and length of the pivot also used to be the same for previous exams, but we don't know if this is still the case.

The tolerances in the exam will be more lenient than what we are working to now.

We start the exam with 2 mm diameter stock, minimum 25 mm in length.

### Functionality
 - Is the winding stem complete?
 - Is the winding stem in tact?
 
## Tuesday
I've annotated the ETA 6498 (also W-01) winding stem diagram with all the steps I need to take:

I've broken another winding stem whilst trying to cut the slot. Possible reasons:
 - slotting tool needed sharpening
 - hardened to beyond cherry red?
 - tempered too quickly (soft skin, hard inner)
 - wrong centre height?

I practised cutting slots for the rest of the day and tried the following:
 - sharpened tool
 - sat down for better centre height view (instead of standing above the work)
 - hardened to cherry red, tempered slowly to dark blue properly

The tool gets blunt quite quickly:

The practice was more successful:

## Wednesday
Started a new winding stem. Got as far as hardening and tempering, ready for slot cutting, etc. on Thursday.

Iron wrapped winding stem, ready for hardening:

The winding stem before bluing:

The winding stem after bluing:

We were given out a Schaublin 70 turning and milling document, covering using the Schaublin, safety, accessories, information and projects.

## Thursday
Successfully cut a slot in the winding stem within diameter tolerance, with quite clean shoulders, but out of tolerance in the hub lengths.

Turned the hubs to diameter next:

During the break I polished my tungsten graver cutting surfaces to a high polish on an *old* 600 gridning wheel:

![Grinding tungsten graver](/images/student-blog/grinding-tungsten-graver.jpeg)

We were introduced to the Schaublin 70. First project was a simple filing button: a thin piece of round steel with a hole in the middle, used for filing the square on a winding stem in the lathe, in order to protect the collet and keep a reference flat side.

![Schaublin 70 filing button step](/images/student-blog/schaublin-filing-button-setup.jpeg)

The button is centre pipped and drilled:

![Schaublin 70 filing button drilling](/images/student-blog/schaublin-filing-button-drilling.jpeg)

The button is then parted off with the parting off graver, at slow speed with oil:

## Friday
Next Schaublin project is the barrel closing tool made in acetal. I completed the base today. We'll work on the cover next week.

![Schaublin 70 project: acetal barrel closer base](/images/student-blog/schaublin-acetal-barrell-closer-base.jpeg)

I finished turning the point on my winding stem. The finishing was very poor -- this area needs work. I tested the completed stem in an ETA 6498 and it all worked correctly: winding, setting, etc.

We were informed of our final exam dates: November 30, December 1 & 2 2022.

## Tired Eyes and Stretches
New guides on tired eyes and body stretches -- both very important whilst working at the bench for long periods of time:

## Weekly Readings
> Jesus said to his disciples: ‘Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and woodworms destroy them and thieves can break in and steal. But store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor woodworms destroy them and thieves cannot break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
>
> ‘The lamp of the body is the eye. It follows that if your eye is sound, your whole body will be filled with light. But if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be all darkness. If then, the light inside you is darkness, what darkness that will be!’

> <cite>Matthew 6:19-23</cite>

> I am the light of the world, says the Lord;<br>
