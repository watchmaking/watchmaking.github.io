## Monday
Back from Easter holidays.

Started working on a filing support tool that we will use later for filing winding stems. The material used is called Acetal -- a sort of white plastic combining low-friction and high-wear resistance.

## Tuesday & Wednesday
Started practicing black polishing on bridge screws, using the bolt tool I made, along with 3M lapping papers and diamond lapping pastes on a zinc block.

We were told that everyone will work out their own method but that the idea is the same: polish flat on less and less coarse laps and pastes until you see no scratches and see a black polished surface. The method that worked for me was: start off with blue 3M lapping film (9 micron) on a glass sheet to ground the screw level, then move on to the pink 3M 3 micron film and then the yellow-green 3M 1 micron film. Clean thoroughly and move onto the zinc block with three pastes: 3.5 micron, 1.5 micron, and 0.5 micron. I'm aware that I'm overlapping the micron counts but this is what worked for me. Films and pastes give different finishes even if they state to be the same micron count.

Cleanliness is the most important and time consuming when black polishing. I came up with a method for cleaning that worked better than Rodico dabbing and ultra sonic machine cleaning. I used pith wood dabbed in isopropanol which I slid across the surface of the screw in the direction of the slot. Each slide I used a different side of the piece of pith wood. Beforehand I gave it a light brushing with iso in a glass jar. It was then that I moved onto pith which gave it the final finish without having to run to the ultra sonic tank for every screw.

## Thursday
It took about one and a half days to successfully polish one screw. I dropped my first black polished bridge screw so the first successful screw was the setting lever screw.

For a while I moved onto two other projects to have a rest from black polishing.

I filed two 20mm tall cylindrical laps in 21mm and 6mm diameters. These will be used for sticking lapping film on their sides, and running bridge sides around them to polish flanks. The bottom surface of the lap needed to be filed by hand and as close to perfect 90 degrees throughout. The smaller lap was much easier than the larger.

Next I cut the stock in Acetal for an anvil and pusher box base project.

## Friday
Continued black polishing but this time tried bevelling the edge of the screw and its slot. The edge I bevelled using a burr tool which gave a quite rough finish -- this will be finished more smoothly on a lathe with a flat lap. The screw slot I bevelled with a triangular Degussit stone. Again, the finish as quite rough and hard to get consistent.

At the end of the day I milled the anvil and pusher box, ready for drilling the holes next week.
