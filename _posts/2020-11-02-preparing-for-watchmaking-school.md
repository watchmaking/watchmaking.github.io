excerpt: Notes on how I prepared before applying to watchmaking school; what books I read; what online courses I bought; what tools I restored and made; and some dexterity exercises I practised.
---

I believe I got into watchmaking school without much trouble because I was prepared and passionate. The global situation which forced the interview process to be conducted entirely online might have also been a factor.

Before I applied I wanted to build up *any* experience with watches that would be good enough to include in my application cover letter. And so I went out and bought a bunch of Donald de Carle, Henry B. Fried, and George Daniels books and studied them. At a certain point in the books one gets stuck due to lack of tools: in my case it was mainspring winders which were too expensive, and a lathe which was too risky to buy without the experience of ever using or buying one. Lack of a dedicated workshop space was also an issue.

## Working on scrap movements
However, there is plenty to do without expensive tools. I started with deconstructing two manual-wind hour, minute, central seconds movements (Citizen 0201). Working on something I didn't mind ruining gave me confidence to work on something nicer. On eBay, I bought a handful of vintage Swiss mechanical movements from de-cased watches. These included ladies-sized movements (variants of the [AS 1012](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&0&2uswk&AS_1012)), one pin-pallet escapement which I've never seen before (see chapter 6 of *Practical Watch Repair*), among others:

There were also some nicer movements which I plan to work on during school. Namely, a Longines L817.4 with the original gold-tone dial and hands, a great condition ladies [Certina 13-20](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?10&ranfft&0&2uswk&Certina_13_20) with a like-new dial, a men's [Certina 25-661](http://www.ranfft.de/cgi-bin/bidfun-db.cgi?12&ranfft&0&2uswk&Certina_25_661) with date, and lastly a very nice Garrard with a beautiful cream dial with blued-steel hands (which I hope to encase at some point):

These watches were more than enough to practice and experiment on. I started with the ladies AS 1012 variants. This in my opinion is better than starting on pocket watch movements as right away you improve your accuracy and dexterity. By practising being precise on these very small movements, working on larger ones becomes easy. It is vital that your screwdriver is correctly adjusted when working on these tiny movements.

I would disassemble, clean, and oil and assemble again one of each of these different types of movements. As I went along I would notice what the differences in designs were exactly.

## Books
For fault finding I followed the first eleven chapters of the Donald de Carle book *Practical Watch Repairing*. The book needs to be very carefully read as the author describes in detail the different methods of examination of the movement. I would have the book open as I worked on a movement, and followed the different examination steps along with the book. It is important to visualise the different exercises he describes. I made a list of notes for each chapter that allowed me to basically follow a check-list of the different areas to examine and check.

Looking at a lot of different movements of the same kind allows you to *feel* what end-shakes and tolerances are correct and which are not. The only way to learn this is by touch.

*Practical Watch Repairing* was the primary book I used during my experimentations. I of course had a look at Daniels' *Watchmaking* and all the other de Carle and Fried titles but *Practical Watch Repairing* contained all the necessary fundamentals.

## Online courses
I bought two online courses whilst reading the above books. The thing about the books is that they don't illustrate visually every single operation described in them. I knew I needed visual aid to begin with. First I bought the Christian Lass [*Watchmaking 101* course](https://learnwatchmaking.com/product/learn-watchmaking-101/). It was very useful in showcasing the absolute fundamentals of watch repair which included the correct way of handling movements, adjusting screwdrivers, how to handle certain parts, description of various functions, and generally useful interjections here and there. I liked the fact he worked for Vianney Halter and had extensive experience in restoration. I found the course to be a great introduction and not much more. If I weren't planning on attending watchmaking school I'd probably look into his *Masterclass 1* course.

It is not necessary to purchase online courses, unless you want to speed up your learning slightly. The books mentioned are excellent but only when you have a watch movement in front of you, and follow each instruction word by word. You don't need to visualise anything with videos, you are simply shown a method right away. Learning from books is more rewarding as you work your way through the chapters, especially each time you successfully replicate what the words are instructing you to do.

The second and last course I bought was Mark Lovick's [*Level 3: Fault finding course*](https://www.watchrepairlessons.com/product/level-3-fault-finding/). This course focused on the initial inspection, the fault finding pathway, testing the escapement, the train and power source, and the keyless and motion works. Basically it covers the respective *Practical Watch Repairing* chapters in video format. I found it useful but a little slow at times. Again, I might  as well just have spent more time following the books and using trial and error finding all this out by myself.

## Tools

Get used to coming up with ideas for different tools and the methods in which you can fabricate them. Without a lathe or even a bench drill I was not able to make most tools I wanted to. I only managed to make some hand leavers (based on the [sample lesson](https://bhi.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BHI-DLC-Technician-Grade-SAMPLE.pdf), pages 75 through 81, of the [BHI Distance Learning Course](https://bhi.co.uk/training-education/dlc/)), a screw-bluing plate, and a screw-polishing jig (which I had to get drilled by someone else so technically I only provided the design and measurements based on the diagram from p. 63 of Daniels' *Watchmaking*). At the very least design your tools on paper with measurements, etc.

Alternatively, you can buy old beat-up tools on eBay and restore them yourself. All that's usually necessary is cleaning agents, rust remover solutions, an ultrasonic cleaner, and sandpaper. In my case I purchased a balance poising tool by *Depose* in very rough shape. Dismantling, de-rusting, polishing, cleaning, and lubricating it was very satisfying. I also bought a balance truing caliper by *Star* which only required a disassembly, a clean, some lubrication and a light polish.

## Dexterity exercises
I improved my dexterity by working on the smallest movements I could find. In my case these were vintage ladies movements of the AS 1012 variant. I unscrewed and screwed the smallest screws many times in a row to ensure I always got into the slot accurately. Lastly, I practised using tweezers as suggested by Daniels:

> Choose a pair of which each limb is shaped with three facets to enable the tweezers to be rolled between the thumb and first two fingers when holding small objects. This is a knack which should be practised until the tweezers can be turned through 360Â° while holding a small component or a screw. Dexterity will improve with each practice and the tweezers, when used for holding small objects for examination on all surfaces, will become a finer extension of the fingers.

Especially with the smaller parts, you need to practise applying the correct pressure using tweezers so that they don't fly off.

All of the above proved very useful in the assessment and interview process of applying and [getting into watchmaking school](/student-blog/getting-into-watchmaking-school). I mentioned all this in my cover letter and in the interview.
