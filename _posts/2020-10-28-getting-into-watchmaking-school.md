The usual application and interview process for the WOSTEP 3'000-hour Program I applied for differed from previous years. Due to the unique situation of the year 2020, the typical assessment consisting of an interview, theory test (numerical and problem solving) and a dexterity test was replaced by an 2-hour online numeracy and logic multiple-choice test followed by a 30-minute video interview.

## The course
The WOSTEP 3'000-hour Program is a course that provides full-time training which gives the opportunity to acquire the expertise of a watchmaker. Graduates are able to service, adjust (repair) and encase various products (both mechanical and electronic) available on the contemporary market. Watch repairers understand and apply various theoretical knowledge to repair situations where they may not have encountered a certain calibre or type of repair previously. Watch repairers are able to evaluate, adjust or manufacture certain components where necessary in order to resolve repairs.

## Initial application
In the cover letter I sent together with the initial application form for the course, I wrote about the reasons I am applying for the course, reasons for my change in career and fields, how and when I became interested in watches, which watchmaking books I read and what I tools and movements I worked with so far. I mentioned how my software programming skills apply to watchmaking: namely logic, problem solving, and critical thinking.

## Planned assessment day
After applying for the course with a cover letter expressing my motivation behind perusing watchmaking I was invited to an all-day assessment which was to consist of workshop exercises (practical puzzles and dexterity tests), written tests (logical reasoning, spacial awareness and numeracy), an interview, and a presentation on one of the three topics: 1. quartz watches, 2. watch and/or clock escapements or 3. history and/or development of timekeeping. I prepared a presentation entitled *Spectral Analysis of Minute-Repeaters*. For this I've extracted the chimes of five Patek Philippe minute-repeaters from YouTube, used an audio processing library for Python, and written tools to generate Mel Spectrograms and pace analysis tables.

A few weeks before the assessment day I was informed it was called off due to a local lockdown, and that it would be replaced by an online test and a video interview.

## Online test
The online test contained about 40 multiple-choice questions which covered mathematics (solving basic quadratic equations), sequences, puzzles, and problem solving exercises. Some questions resembled these examples:

I completed the test within about an hour and spent the other hour thoroughly checking my answers. A few days after completing the test, I received an invitation for a video interview.

## Video interview
During the video interview the interviewer asked what my motivation behind applying to the school was and double-checked whether the 3'000-hour course was right for me (the school also offers the shorter 1'800-hour technician course). I got the feeling that the interviewer wanted to see whether watchmaking was something I was passionate about or something I looked into briefly. Early in the interview he said I answered all his questions after showing him a box of watch movements I was working on and the tools I already bought, restored, or made myself. I never got to present my spectral analysis work.

The schools are primarily looking for passionate candidates who didn't pick watchmaking on a whim. This WOSTEP course states that no previous watchmaking experience is required but obviously the fact I did have *some* watch repair experience proved useful in the interview process and in eventually securing a place.

## Other courses
Before applying, I researched courses other than the WOSTEP one I eventually chose, and inquired about the cost of the 2 year full-skill program in traditional watchmaking at the [K&H Watchmaking Competence Center](http://www.khwcc.ch/). The location and cost of the course are the reasons I decided not to apply for it. The school is based in Le Locle, Switzerland where the estimated cost of living is around CHF 1200 to CHF 2000 per month. The cost of personal tools required for the course is about CHF 2000 and the final exam costs CHF 1500. The 5 day bench test costs CHF 850 (excluding living costs). The cost of the course is CHF 30,000 per year. In total, the estimated minimum cost of the two years of study is about CHF 78,750.

Another option was the [British Horological Institute](https://bhi.co.uk/) Distance Learning Course which on paper costs much less than any watchmaking school but the cost of equipment would still be substantial. Additionally, I did not have the workshop space to dedicate to perusing this self-learning path.

There are a number of brand watchmaking schools in Europe which I didn't have a chance to look into. The alternate path of perusing an apprenticeship in watchmaking quickly become an impossibility due to the evolving pandemic.

## Motivations behind applying
> Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more, and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: **You should mind your own business and work with your hands**, just as we told you, so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.
