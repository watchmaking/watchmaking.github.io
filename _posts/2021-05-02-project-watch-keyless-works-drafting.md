## Setting lever jumper
The setting lever jumper in the Dufour Simplicity is where my inspiration lies, from both the finishing point of view and the shape design of the component itself:

### Drafting and functionality
For drafting, I used Photoshop. I got the setting lever jumper component design [from ETA](https://www.eta.ch/en/our-products/mechanical-movements/mecaline/eta-mecaline-6498-1-unitas-unavailable), placed it as the background, used the magic wand and bucket tool to have a layer to shape using the eraser tool.

### Draft #1
I'm happy with the first draft. I like the light contours. Whilst erasing the original layer, I kept in mind the functionality of each piece of the component. For example, I kept the area over the yoke which helps keep it down. The area over the motion work wheels was also kept as to keep them down. I added two inspection holes.

### Draft #2
The second draft is an alternative to #1, in case the area around the yoke is not strong enough to hold it down. In #2 I keep the area which wraps around the yoke hole. This is my least favourite design of the three -- I failed to keep the nice proportions and the modified yoke area is ugly.

### Draft #3
For this final draft, I took into account the fact that I can modify the yoke/yoke spring components so that they are one, and held by a screw -- a bit like these pocket watch Patek and Vacheron keyless works:

The design omits the area around the yoke spring as it would be held down by a screw and not the setting lever jumper plate above.

This design is my favourite of the three. I wanted to modify the yoke and yoke spring anyway.

## Yoke and yoke spring
As per above examples from Patek and Vacheron, I want the two components (yoke and yoke spring) as one. I can see the possibility of either modifying an existing yoke to turn it into a spring, or creating a new component based on the existing yoke. I'm leaning towards making a new component because the area left by the yoke spring might look out of place and lack proportion.

I will discuss the options with my tutor next week, but after trying to draft the yoke from the existing component in Photoshop I found the end result poor in balance and ugly. I think I will need to fashion a new component altogether for the yoke and yoke spring union.
