## Monday & Tuesday
Completed another practice stem in 5 hours 30 minutes. Tried W28 diamond paste followed by W20 -- the latter by itself will be enough, if I fiber scratch brush the blue off the square before lapping. Used soap whilst hardening this time as well.

Got the stem marked. I left the square chamfer not done as I wasn't confident doing that operation, and didn't want to bend the stem. During marking of this stem I got the following:
 - chatter, turned oval (bad finish overall);
 - no bevel on square end;
 - square shaft tapered towards hub: possibly during lapping;
 - outer hub over tolerance;
 - slot under tolerance;
 - not to overall length.

The mark for this stem was 74%. I went back and adjusted the outer hub and slot to get them into tolerance. I also cut the square chamfer. This boosted the mark to 84% (83% if the marker was more strict with cylindrical surfaces because of cutting into pivot). After adjusting the total length by stoning the thread end on an India stone, the final mark was 88% -- highest result to day.

I made a shoulder graver tool for cutting more accurate 90 degree shoulders.

## Wednesday
First mock winding stem exam. Completed in 5 hours 40 minutes (out of 8 hours permitted).

## Thursday
Mock exam stem marked at 64%: poorest result to day and practically the lowest in class. The square and slot area had the most issues. All issues included:
 - chamfer of square poor (due to pivot bending whilst using shoulder tool for first time on that area);
 - square off-center (due to bent pivot), square tapered (badly turned before filing);
 - pivot surface finish inconsistent (due to bent pivot);
 - slipped whilst turning square chamfer and marked square deeply (due to bent pivot);
 - left shoulder of slot slightly dished, slot slightly barrelled;
 - pivot tapered, square out of diameter tolerances;
 - diagonal of square out of tolerance;
 - pivot and square lengths out (this was the area I used the shoulder tool on, resulting in going under and bending);
 - outer hub and slot lengths out of tolerance (focused too much on visual finish).

I focused too much on the aesthetics of the surfaces and shoulders as those were poor in my previous practice stem -- because of this I overlooked the most important dimension tolerances. The hub-square shoulder was very good because of button alignment, but that's about the only good thing about this stem.

In addition, the previous practice stem which scored my highest mark yet, gave me false confidence in my skills which resulted in too much pride and *[not enough humility](/guides/humility)*, which in turn reflected negatively on my first mock exam score.

In conclusion, the mock exam taught me these indispensable lessons:
 - prefer hitting dimension tolerances instead of going after aesthetics;
 - don't try new methods or approaches during the exam;
 - increase humility -- uproot conceit and false confidence.

Also worth noting, is that if you do go under tolerance on something and can't save it, go back and tidy up the finish or shoulders -- in this way you can at least grab *some* marks.

For the rest of the day I practiced the hammered brass technique. I'm reconsidering making this the chosen finish on my project watch as this technique interferes with the base plate too much (especially on the barrel area and around jewel holes).

The finish definitely needs to be completed in one sitting, because the pressure of the taps needs to be consistent. I will either use this finish on another component (such as the balance cock), or have a skeleton or partial dial.

Another finish I tried was frosting using Aluminum Oxide on float glass. If the surface were clean and lightly polished, the frosting would be brighter. The base plate I used was from the scrap drawer and tarnished:

We were shown how to use the sand-blaster machine, which gives a matte surface finish -- not something I'm planning on using in my project watch, but something we have to use in the W-01.

I started a new practice stem at the end of the day.

## Friday
Bent practice stem because I was rushing whilst cutting the slot. Started another one, which I'll complete on Monday morning. Discussed new WOSTEP marking criteria which splits the marking categories further allowing to score marks on more specific parts of the stem -- at the same time some tolerances were tightened, which all in all should make it slightly easier to pass, but much harder to get near full marks.
