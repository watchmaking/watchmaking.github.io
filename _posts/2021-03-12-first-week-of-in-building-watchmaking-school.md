## Monday
Finally back in the building after seven weeks of remote learning using Zoom. We started off with an induction about general health and safety and fire safety. Interesting to note the precautions the school takes in storing chemicals which are in fire-proof locked cabinets with drip trays. The chemicals used for the cleaning machine are particularly dangerous.

Next, we picked our benches and vacuumed them. We had to bring all the tools we were given back in January into the school, which all fit in a duffel-bag and were awkward to carry. The tools we brought in and the remainder that stayed in school were all put into the different bench drawers. There was a set of tools that we borrowed from school, which we documented and checked out so that we can return them at the end of the two years. Among them a very nice and rare Luthy tool for vibrating hairsprings; a Horia jewelling set with anvils; a Star/Bergeon staking set; among others. We measured and ordered the anvil set for the Horia tool to make sure it is not damaged and within specification.

All the presentations we were given as PDFs during the past two months were given out in printed paper form to put into ring binders.

I'm anticipating having a beautiful time at the school for the next two years.

## Tuesday
A presentation on drills and a primer on using the milling machine. We started off with drilling wooden hand files in order to get acquainted with setting up and using the machine.

Some notes on setup:
1. Choose appropriate drill bit -- in this case we had to drill two different diameter holes with differing depths to accommodate the specific file tangs which are tapered; these are then hammered down into the wooden handle with a mallet;
2. Mount the drill bit to the chuck and tighten securely; secure the piece in the bottom vice, remembering to remove the tightening key before continuing;
3. Center the work piece with the drill bit in X, Y, Z positions (by eye), and reset the readouts on the right; check visually in two planes whilst turning the chuck by hand to ensure the alignment is centered;
4. Zero the Z axis (the top which holds the chuck) on the top of the work piece so that we can accurately drill the desired depths;
5. Wear eye protection and start the machine;
6. Pull the handle on the right down gently and slowly, back out, back down, etc. -- take your time and drill slowly;
7. Turn off machine.

Next, we began working on the file cleaner project. A very simple 20 x 50 x 2 mm brass piece for cleaning clogged files. We roughly measured out the piece on a large brass plate, using a black marker and scriber. The piece was cut out with a hack saw, ready for filing.

## Wednesday
Morning presentation on files and filing techniques covering drill types (most common is twist drill, and then center drill which is used for piloting); HSS, tungsten carbide; machine safety; checking drill condition before using (vital for micro-mechanics); drilling techniques and drilling various materials; and finishing drilled holes (taper broaches, reamers, countersinks).

For the rest of the day we filed the file cleaner. This means filing a reference side which is fully true, and working on the other three sides from that reference side. We needed to ensure trueness, flatness, right-angles, and keeping in mind the tolerances of ±0.2mm. Today I finished three sides. I've left quite a large chunk extra whilst sawing so I have to file down about 5mm of brass -- it will take a while. We are collecting the brass shavings to use later when bluing components. I also completed drilling the rest of the file handles.

## Thursday
More filing. I completed my first file cleaner to within tolerances, and stamped my initial on it. I stamped further two numbers relating to the coarseness of the file I'll be using them on. De-burred the edges and finished with a simple graining. Not a perfect finish but good enough since this is a quite crude tool. Next projects will have nicer finishing.

The cleaner works very well.

In the afternoon I made another cleaner for my 5 and 6 files.

Later, we started working on the bolt tool used for black polishing. This is from a much thicker 5 mm brass plate measuring approximately 30 x 40 mm, similar to the Daniels design from his *Watchmaking* book. Today I got the rough plate cut out and started working on the reference side. Much more difficult to get a flat surface in two planes with this thicker sheet.

## Friday
In the morning I finished the reference side of my bolt tool, and will be finishing the other three sides next week. Later we got a demonstration of using the milling machine for drilling brass and also got an introduction on taps and dies -- both operations we will need for the bolt tool. The catch is that if we break a drill inside the tool, it is almost impossible to get it out, in which case we have to start all over again.

In the afternoon we looked at past student projects and looked at some scrap bridges, base plates, etc. that the students practiced on -- a finishing that immediately caught my eye was a frosted barrel bridge with rose gold plating, and a base plate with very fine spotting in the recesses.

At the end of the day we cleaned the entire workshop by vacuuming, wiping all surfaces, and mopping -- with an early finish at 4 PM.
