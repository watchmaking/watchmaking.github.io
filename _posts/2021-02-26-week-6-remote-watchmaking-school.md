Some interesting points about the [quartz crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_crisis).

Not part of the syllabus but also mentioned [Bulova Accutron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPS7aNCAwAA) and [Grand Seiko Spring Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoEorK6elZM).

## Thursday
Casing presentation covering case design (bezel, case middle, case back), case cleaning, snap fit case back opening and closing, case knife press, case press, case back opener, types of fittings of acrylic plexi-glass and crystals, glass/crystal press, tension ring glass fitting, crystal with gasket fitting, casing screws and casing clamps, and movement to case attachment with casing ring.

In the afternoon, we disassembled the ETA 955.112 and ETA 2824-2, mixed them up in the bell jar and assembled them again. Good exercise for screw identification.

## Friday
Crowns and pushers presentation covering crown design (crown, crown gasket, case tube), screw down crown components (crown, gaskets, case tube, plunger, spring), Rolex-style screw down crowns, fitting a new crown or winding stem, Loctite thread locker, chronograph/case pushers, and correctors.

Group discussion of personal project ideas. After some thought I think I'll focus on modifying the ETA 6498-1 to have a three-quarter plate with upgraded click spring and yoke spring so that they use proper screwed down types instead of flimsy cheap springs. After that I'll focus on a reasonable amount of finishing and if time allows, an addition of a moon phase complication. The inspiration behind the movement design and finishing (e.g. frosting) is from the [A. Lange & Söhne 1815 Thin Honeygold](https://monochrome-watches.com/a-lange-sohne-1815-thin-honeygold-homage-to-f-a-lange-hands-on-review-price/):
