> Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more, and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.

## Independents on restoration
An overwhelming majority of independents have had the experience of working in vintage or antique watch and/or clock **restoration** before starting their own brands.

> Immediately after graduation, I worked with my uncle. **Working on these old pieces gave me a real physical sense of the history of the craft.** I found it fascinating understanding why different watchmakers took different approaches over the years. I then focussed on the second half of the 18th Century, because it was far more developed with certain standards in place. The watches were more efficient, with a lot of cerebral challenges leading to moments of genius. I remember the first time I saw a marine chronometer, not even a particularly important one, but the quality of the solution and finishing was something I found very impressive.

> I began taking meetings in Geneva and found an auction house which was called Galerie d’Horlogerie Ancienne, which would later become Antiquorum, and they gave me a box of about 40 watches to restore for them. I did this for about five years or so, restoring old watches and pocket watches.
>
> I learned a lot during that period. **I got to understand so many different mechanisms with different approaches to the same kinds of problems. You begin to imagine how they achieved certain things with machinery that is long gone**, it was very interesting. I became very fond of watches made between 1800 and 1920, because these are watches that, when restored, you can expect a good timekeeping result from. Watches before 1700, you’re just happy that it makes a tick tack sound when you’re done.

> **I admire old masters like Breguet, Berthoud** etc. They were true masters and scientist mastering astronomy and inventors. They did first theory books for us.
>
> I have restored watches made by these great masters, and it is something very special and impossible to describe the feeling once working on that type of timepiece.

> In Paris **I first worked for a clockmaker restorer of antique clocks, then another restaurateur, antique watches** this time.

> **Read books.** Lots of them. Find books your tutors have never heard of. Find American, Chinese, Israeli or Russian books on horology. There is little new in the art and it has been studied in depth by diligent people. As the years go by you will start to read them with an ever more critical eye, picking out the good and the bad, as you yourself see fit.
>
> There are usually a few ways to approach any task in horology. People will bicker and snipe about which is correct. Try them all and see which one suits you, or best suits the particular task you need to accomplish.

> If I'm asked what to do to become an independent creative watchmaker, my advice is **always to repair or just look at as many old watches as possible**. And by old watches I don't mean only the best watches by the old masters, but also cheap and heavily worn and used old watches from the flea marked. From these watches, **one learns what works and what does not, which technical solutions ultimately do stand the test of time**.
