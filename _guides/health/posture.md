## Posture in classics
> **If the watchmaker is so wrapped up in his work that he is not properly aware of his discomfort his health will soon suffer.**
>
> The height of benches and seats is important if comfort is to be assured during long periods of sitting. The seat should be of hard, polished wood, shaped at the front edge to **relieve pressure on the thighs**. A polished seat will allow slight changes in position while working, without shifting the weight of the body on to the feet. **When seated the thighs should be horizontal and the lower leg vertical.** If the foot is now moved forward or backward the knee will be lowered, allowing a change of position during the most concentrated work without having to move the seat. It is tiring to sit for long periods with the thighs sloping up or down from the body while the lower leg is vertical.

> The height of the stool is important. No general rule can be made, but it should enable the watch repairer to **sit comfortably without the necessity of crouching down at the work**. He should **feel quite at ease**.

Feet should be touching the floor fully flat. **Allow a clear sight of the work without forward curvature of the spine.** It is better to raise the work to the level of sight rather than to lower the head to the level of the work. **Sit with a straight back and relaxed.** Be **mindful of your posture** and resolve issues as soon as you notice them.

## Additional publications
An industry document by the Swiss insurance company Suva on the ergonomics of workstations in precision work in the watch industry is available for [download in French](/downloads/Proper%20Workshop%20Working%20Conditions%20SUVA-French.pdf) (original), as well as a machine-translated [version in English](/downloads/Proper%20Workshop%20Working%20Conditions%20SUVA-English%20Translation.pdf). The document contains text and graphics in order to explore, analyse, and offer solutions for proper workshop working conditions:

> Precision work is above all characterized by a vision-oriented activity. This determines the position of the eye (and therefore the head) relative to the work-piece. The position of the hands is a second determining factor. This is defined by the part to be worked and by the tools used. The position of the rest of the body adapts to the given conditions.
>
> In order to prevent harmful postures, the workstation must be adapted at two levels:
> 1. the specific requirements of the activity, such as viewing distance, viewing angle, and hand position and posture;
> 2. the individual specificities of the worker, especially their size and visual acuity.
>
> In order to meet these basic requirements, the workstation must meet the following conditions:
> - be height adjustable, or workbenches of different heights must be available;
> - arm or hand supports must be available for precision manual work; they are used to support the upper limbs and stabilize the hand; the height and angle of the stand must be adjustable;
> - the seat and the backrest must be individually adjustable;
> - the freedom of movement under the workbench and at chair level should not be obstructed.
>
> *Relaxed working atmosphere:* In addition to physical nuisances, workers can also suffer from psychological disturbances, for example due to inadequate organization, too much pressure to perform or tensions between people. Negative stress can over time make you sick or make symptoms of other illnesses worse.

> *Exercise and regeneration phases in the organization of work:* A static posture leads to body pain and reduces the ability to concentrate. These symptoms are even stronger when a person is under stress. To remedy this effectively, regular breaks should be taken during work. These allow to regenerate the body, the eyes and the mind at the same time.
> Regeneration phases include eye relaxation exercises; getting up and taking a few steps helps stimulate the large muscle groups and improves blood circulation. To maintain health, everyone should also exercise regularly during leisure time.
