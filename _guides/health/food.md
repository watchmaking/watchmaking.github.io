> But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the royal rations of food and wine; so he asked the palace master to allow him not to defile himself. Now God allowed Daniel to receive favor and compassion from the palace master. The palace master said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king; he has appointed your food and your drink. If he should see you in poorer condition than the other young men of your own age, you would endanger my head with the king.” Then Daniel asked the guard whom the palace master had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: “**Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.** You can then compare our appearance with the appearance of the young men who eat the royal rations, and deal with your servants according to what you observe.” So he agreed to this proposal and tested them for ten days. **At the end of ten days it was observed that they appeared better and fatter than all the young men who had been eating the royal rations. So the guard continued to withdraw their royal rations and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables. To these four young men God gave knowledge and skill in every aspect of literature and wisdom; Daniel also had insight into all visions and dreams.**

> One student shows me the hand exercises he does—pushing his fingers together like a slow-motion high five, or rotating his wrists—and says he's sworn off alcohol, "at least for a long time," because it might make his hand tremor. He doesn't drink coffee, either, for the same reason. He carries around eye drops and eats foods that are good for his sight, like blueberries and carrots. "When it comes to watchmaking," he says, "I want to perform my best."
