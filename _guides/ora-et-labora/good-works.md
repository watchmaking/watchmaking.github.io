## Prologue
Listen carefully, my son, to the master's instructions, and attend to them with the ear of your heart. This is advice from a father who loves you; welcome it, and faithfully put it into practice. The labor of obedience will bring you back to him from whom you had drifted through the sloth of disobedience. This message of mine is for you, then, if you are ready to give up your own will, once and for all, and armed with the strong and noble weapons of obedience to do battle for the true King, Christ the Lord.

First of all, every time you begin a good work, you must pray to him most earnestly to bring it to perfection. In his goodness, he has already counted us as his sons, and therefore we should never grieve him by our evil actions. With his good gifts which are in us, we must obey him at all times that he may never become the angry father who disinherits his sons, nor the dread lord, enraged by our sins, who punishes us forever as worthless servants for refusing to follow him to glory.

Let us get up then, at long last, for the Scriptures rouse us when they say: *It is high time for us to arise from sleep* (Rom 13:11). Let us open our eyes to the light that comes from God, and our ears to the voice from heaven that every day calls out this charge: *If you hear his voice today, do not harden your hearts* (Ps 94[95]:8).

And again: *You that have ears to hear, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches* (Rev 2:7). And what does he say? *Come and listen to me, sons; I will teach you the fear of the Lord* (Ps 33[34]:12). *Run while you have the light* of life, *that the darkness* of death *may not overtake you* (John 12:35).

Seeking his workman in a multitude of people, the Lord calls out to him and lifts his voice again: *Is there anyone here who years for life and desires to see good days?* (Ps 33[34]:13). If you hear this and your answer is "I do", God then directs these words to you: If you desire true and eternal life, *keep your tongue free from vicious talk and your lips from all deceit; turn away from evil and do good; let peace be your quest and aim* (Ps 33[34]:14--15). Once you have done this, my *eyes will be upon* you *and* my *ears will listen* for your *prayers; and even before you ask me, I will say* to you: *Here I am* (Isa 58:9).

What, dear brothers, is more delightful than this voice of the Lord calling to us? See how the Lord in his love shows us the way of life. Clothed then with faith and the performance of good works, let us set out on this way, with the Gospel for our guide, that we may deserve to see him *who has called* us *to his kingdom* (1 Thess 2:12).

If we wish to dwell in the tent of this kingdom, we will never arrive unless we run there by doing good deeds. But let us ask the Lord and the Prophet: *Who will dwell in your tent, Lord; who will find rest upon your holy mountains?* (Ps 14[15]:1).

After this question, brothers, let us listen well to what the Lord says in reply, for he shows us the way to his tent. *One who walks without blemish*, he says, *and is just in all his dealings; who speaks the truth from his heart and has not practiced deceit with his tongue, who has not wronged a fellowman in any way, nor listened to slanders against his neighbor* (Ps 14[15]2--3). He has *foiled* the *evil one*, the devil, at every turn, flinging both him and his promptings far *from the sight* of his heart. While these temptations were still *young, he caught hold of them and dashed them against* Christ (Ps 14[15]:4; 136[137]:9).

These people *fear the Lord*, and do not become elated over their good deeds; they judge it is the Lord's power, not their own, that brings about the good in them. *They praise* (Ps 14[15]:4) the Lord working in them, and say with the Prophet: *Not to us, Lord, not to us give the glory, but to your name alone* (Ps 113[115:1]:9). In just this way Paul the Apostle refused to take credit for the power of his preaching. He declared: *By God's grace I am what I am* (1 Cor 15:10).

And again he said: *He who boasts should make his boast in the Lord* (2 Cor 10:17). That is why the Lord says in the Gospel: *Whoever hears these words of mine and does them is like a wise man who built his house upon rock; the floods came and the winds blew and beat against the house, but it did not fall: it was founded on rock* (Matt 7:24--25).

With this conclusion, the Lord waits for us daily to translate into action, as we should, his holy teachings. Therefore our life span has been lengthened by way of a truce, that we may amend our misdeeds. As the Apostle says: *Do you not know that the patience of God is leading you to repent* (Rom 2:4)?

And indeed the Lord assures us in his love: *I do not wish the death of the sinner, but that he turn back to me and live* (Ezek 33:11).

Brothers, now that we have asked the Lord who will dwell in his tent, we have heard the instruction for dwelling in it, but only if we fulfill the obligations of those who live there. We must, then, prepare our hearts and bodies for the battle of holy obedience to his instructions. What is not possible to us by nature, let us ask the Lord to supply by the help of his grace. If we wish to reach eternal life, even as we avoid the torments of hell, then---while there is still time, while we are in this body and have time to accomplish all these things by the light of life---we must run and do now what will profit us forever.

Therefore we intend to establish a school for the Lord's service. In drawing up its regulations, we hope to set down nothing harsh, nothing burdensome. The good of all concerned, however, may prompt us to a little strictness in order to amend faults and to safeguard love. Do not be daunted immediately by fear and run away from the road that leads to salvation. It is bound to be narrow at the outset. But as we progress in this way of life and in faith, we shall run on the path of God's commandments, our hearts overflowing with the inexpressible delight of love. Never swerving from his instructions, then, but faithfully observing his teaching in the monastery until death, we shall through patience share in the sufferings of Christ that we may deserve also to share in his kingdom. Amen.

## The Tools for Good Works
First of all, *love the Lord God with your whole heart, your whole soul and all your strength, and love your neighbor as yourself* (Matt 22:37--39; Mark 12:30--31; Luke 10:27). 
Then the following: *You are not to kill, not to commit adultery; you are not to steal nor to covet* (Rom 13:9); *you are not to bear false witness* (Matt 19:18; Mark 10:19; Luke 18:20). *You must honor everyone* (1 Pet 2:17), and *never do to another what you do not want done to yourself* (Tob 4:16; Matt 7:12; Luke 6:31). 

*Renounce yourself in order to follow Christ* (Matt 16:24; Luke 9:23); *discipline your body* (1 Cor 9:27); do not pamper yourself; but love fasting. You must relieve the lot of the poor, *clothe the naked*, *visit the sick* (Matt 25:36), and bury the dead. Go to help the troubled and console the sorrowing.

Your way of acting should be different from the world's way; the love of Christ must come before all else. You are not to act in anger nor nurse a grudge. Rid your heart of all deceit. Never give a hollow greeting of peace or turn away when someone needs your love. Bind yourself to no oath lest it prove false but speak the truth with heart and tongue.

*Do not repay one bad turn with another* (1 Thess 5:15; 1 Pet 3:9). Do not injure anyone, but bear injuries patiently. *Love your enemies* (Matt 5:44; Luke 6:27). If people curse you, do not curse them back but bless them instead. *Endure persecution for the sake of justice* (Matt 5:10).

You must *not* be *proud, nor be given to wine* (Titus 1:7, 1 Tim 3:3). Refrain from too much eating or sleeping, and *from laziness* (Rom 12:11). Do not grumble or speak ill of others.

Place your hope in God alone. If you notice something good in yourself, give credit to God, not to yourself, but be certain that the evil you commit is always your own and yours to acknowledge.

Live in fear of judgment day and have a great horror of hell. Yearn for everlasting life with holy desire. Day by day remind yourself that you are going to die. Hour by hour keep careful watch over all you do, aware that God's gaze is upon you, wherever you may be. As soon as wrongful thoughts come into your heart, dash them against Christ and disclose them to your spiritual father. Guard your lips from harmful or deceptive speech. Prefer moderation in speech and speak no foolish chatter, nothing just to provoke laughter; do not love immoderate or boisterous laughter.

Listen readily to holy reading, and devote yourself often to prayer. Every day with tears and sighs confess your past sins to God in prayer and change from these evil ways in the future.

*Do not gratify the promptings of the flesh* (Gal 5:16); hate the urgings of self-will. Obey the orders of the abbot unreservedly, even if his own conduct---which God forbid---be at odds with what he says. Remember the teaching of the Lord: *Do what they say, not what they do* (Matt 23:3).

Do not aspire to be called holy before you really are, but first be holy that you may more truly be called so. Live by God's commandments every day; treasure chastity, harbor neither hatred nor jealousy of anyone, and do nothing out of envy. Do not love quarreling; shun arrogance. Respect the elders and love the young. Pray for your enemies out of love for Christ. If you have a dispute with someone, make peace with him before the sun goes down.

And finally, never lose hope in God's mercy.

These, then are the tools of the spiritual craft. When we have used them without ceasing day and night and have returned them on judgment day, our wages will be the reward the Lord has promised: *What the eyes have not seen nor the ear heard, God has prepared for those who love him* (1 Cor 2:9).

The workshop where we are to toil faithfully at all these tasks is the enclosure of the monastery and stability in the community.
