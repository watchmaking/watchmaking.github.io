I want to improve the setting lever jumper and the yoke/yoke spring components.</description> <pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate> <link>https://watchmaking.xyz/student-blog/project-watch-keyless-works-drafting</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://watchmaking.xyz/student-blog/project-watch-keyless-works-drafting</guid> </item> <item> <title>Week 14: Watchmaking School</title> <description>Working on the brass and steel cubes, sawing support, dynamic poising support, and discussing ideas for project watch.</description> <pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate> <link>https://watchmaking.xyz/student-blog/week-14-watchmaking-school</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://watchmaking.xyz/student-blog/week-14-watchmaking-school</guid> </item> <item> <title>Project Watch: Initial Ideas</title> <description>General project watch ideas including design and features of dial and movement side.
