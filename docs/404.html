				"title": "Timekeeping and Christian Monasticism",
				"content": " An extract from Christianson’s book, Timepieces: Masters of Chronometry, which explains the influence of the Christian monastic tradition on the invention of the first all-mechanical clocks. The first rule of the regulations governing the Genevan Corporation of Watchmakers craft guild, reviewed and approved in council on 19 January 1601, is:  All the assembled master watchmakers will be obligated to pray to God, asking His Presence within their midst, so that they would only say or do only those things that would honor God and benefit the City.  \t\tTimepieces: Masters of Chronometry by David Christianson, Firefly Books, p. 68, ‘The Geneva Rules of 1601 (Abridged)’“A Call to Prayer”Although a little rough around the edges in regards to the details of the Christian tradition, giving way to some inaccurate generalizations, the quoted parts presented here nevertheless give a well-rounded and fair historical overview of horology in the Christian world setting.Selections from the first chapter, A Call to Prayer, describing the monastic influence on the development of timekeeping and alarm devices:  A faint peal of the bells from the monastery atop a distant hill reminded the faithful that it was time for prayer. Within the highly regulated medieval community of the monastery, the brothers, lay brothers and servants were busy everywhere. They lived and worked to the bells that called them to a daily regimen of prayer and ceremony, work and meditation. Time was of the essence because time belonged to God and it could not be wasted.  The monastery ran by strict rules and an unerring schedule. It was the duty of those in the monastery to pray, and to pray often, in order to save the multitude of faithful outside the monastery, whose worldly duties kept them from devoting their full time to the service of God. Their praying took the form of seven daytime services, called canonical hours, because they were recited at specified times, and one at night called the vigil. Organized around these “hours” were times for individual prayer, study and the other activities of cloistered life.  To the Christian, simultaneous group prayer was considered the most powerful form of prayer. Time discipline was taken seriously in the monastery, and nothing was so important as the punctual, collective prayer, chanted aloud. It was not acceptable to be late for prayer. To the Christian community, the whole was greater than the sum of the individual parts.  The Christian was different from adherents of the other religions that worshiped the same God. The Judaic worshiper is obligated to pray three times a day, but not at specific times: in the morning after the sun comes up; in the afternoon before sunset; and in the evening after dark. Nature gave the pious Jew the signals to pray—no timepiece or alarm was needed.  Islam calls for five daily prayers: at dawn (just before sunrise); just after noon when the sun is highest; sometime in the afternoon before sunset; just after sunset; and then after dark. Here again, nature gives the signals for prayer. In both Judaism and Islam, local religious leaders could set times for prayer, but these times were not absolute.  Offering daily prayers the requisite three or five times was absolutely necessary, but great leeway was given for when they were offered. After all, in both Islam and Judaism, prayer is a personal act and (with some exceptions) need not be carried out as part of a group.  Christianity, especially that practiced in the monasteries, was different. The early Christians had no standard liturgy, they were not yet even a Church. But, since most of the originators of Christianity were Jews, they used the practices of the older faith to build their own. They accepted the morning and evening prayers “when you lie down and when you rise” (Deuteronomy 6:7), and the three daily prayers called for by Daniel, when he got “down on his knees three times a day to pray to his God and praise him” (Daniel 6:10). And they added additional times, making eight in all, in order to distinguish themselves from the Hebrew practitioners of the faith. As the Christian Church developed, these times of prayer became a part of the Church canon of law and divided the day into canonical hours around which all other activities were organized. The apostle Paul taught that the faithful should be in a state of continual prayer (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, Ephesians 6:18). By virtue of their calling, the monks were in a perpetual state of communion with God, no matter what they were doing: they made no distinction between work and prayer. To them work was prayer (see ora et labora).  \t\tTimepieces: Masters of Chronometry by David Christianson, Firefly Books, p. 19-20“Orderliness and Measured Time”  To become organized and stay organized, the monasteries measured time. The ringing of bells alerted the cloistered community to the daily activities, calling them to prayer, to study, to work, to sleep—big bells and little bells, each with its own meaning. For hundreds of years the hourglass, clepsydra and the calibrated burning lamp were the instruments used to remind the bell-ringers when to signal the next event. To adjust for the changing daylight and nighttime hours, the clerics carefully measured and proportioned the time, calculating the length of each night and day for every day of the year, measuring to the nearest quarter-hour or so because the time-measuring devices were no more accurate than this.  Time mattered to the monks because being late for the all-important prayer was stealing time away from God; and sleeping through the nighttime vigil could have serious consequences. The apostle Matthew admonished the faithful that the Lord would come at an hour when they would not expect him (Matthew 24:42-44). And Luke added that “if he comes in the second watch, or in the third” blessed are the servants who are watching for the Second Coming of the Lord. Woe be, then, to the poor bell-ringer who failed to awaken his brethren for the nighttime vigil!  \t\tTimepieces: Masters of Chronometry by David Christianson, Firefly Books, p. 20-21“Automating the Ringing Bell”  It was for the potentially hapless nighttime bell-ringer that the mechanical alarm developed. Akin to our baking timer, the alarm timer would run for hours, tripping an alarm at the appointed time and awakening the bell-ringer who would then ring the vigil bell for the rest of the monastery. These devices were not clocks in our sense of the term. They did not record the time or run continuously. They were timers.  The alarm timer that woke the bell-ringer evolved in the twelfth century into a mechanism that actually rang the bell, using a series of gear wheels that were driven or powered by a falling weight. The gears would turn a ratcheting lever that clamored against the bell. A clepsydra would determine when to release the bell-ringing mechanism. This clepsydra-controlled automated bell was ideal on a small scale, but to ring the bells on a large scale—the big bell in the monastery tower, for instance—required a different controller. It was not practical to bring water up into a tower to feed the clepsydra that controlled the large automated bells.  Inventive clerics and blacksmiths put their minds together and, in the thirteenth century, the true mechanical clock emerged—unique to Europe. Other countries had their sundials and clepsydras, but only Europe had the mechanical clock. Using the weight-driven gear wheels of the alarm mechanism, these creative geniuses realized that the back-and-forth motion of the bell-ringer could be used to control the speed of the gears. By placing small weights on both ends of the ringing lever, they made a speed governor that released the Power of the weight-driven gear wheels at a relatively constant rate. The last wheel in the gear train is the crown wheel (so named because it looks like a crown). Its pointed tips, which were blocked and released by pallets on the axle of the oscillating lever, gave a back-and-forth motion to this oscillating lever arm. The pallets on the axle were called the verge, and the crown wheel was called the escape wheel, because this wheel allowed the rotating motion of the gear train to “escape” one tooth at a time. The speed of the escaping teeth was governed by the length of the lever arm, called a foliot, because it seemed to have a mad motion as it moved back and forth (from the Old French fol= mad.)  By moving the weights on the ends of the foliot, the rate of its oscillation could be changed—up or down—to bring the speed of the escaping wheels into some standard, measurable rate. The standard would be the time from sunrise to sunrise. By adding the correct ratio of gear wheels, the clockmaker could produce a series of gears, one of which would turn every 12 hours. With a lever on that wheel, it could ring a bell twice a day, and an indicator hand on the wheel would give you a clock to record and measure time. For a long time the hand was not there. The clock simply struck the bells and you knew that it was time for prayer or work or sleep by the number and sound of the bells.  \t\tTimepieces: Masters of Chronometry by David Christianson, Firefly Books, p. 21-22Related Guides\tDifficult Tasks guide\tGood Works guide\tHumility guide\tObedience guide",

I made my own:Broke my winding stem whilst trying to cut the slot.Winding Stem ExamWe went through the marking criteria for the 8 hour winding stem intermediate exam. We are marked on the following:Appearance, surface finish  Hubs must be cylindrical with consistent finish;  All shoulders must be 90 degree, sharper interior corners, with graver finish;  Bevel on front of square must be consistent 45 degree angle, with graver finish;  Flat surface of square must be true, flat, and consistent;  Centring of square to pivot is observed;  Slot must be 90 degrees, with sharp interior corners, with graver finish;  Thread must be consistently threaded, with peaks of threads not damaged or clipped, tempered blue finish;  All corners bevelled to 45 degree angle to remove burrs, not visible with naked eye.Dimensions and lengths  Pivot;  Square shaft, checked if taper is within tolerance;  Diagonal of square, to check if stock was turned to dimension;  Winding pinion step;  Inner hub;  Outer hub;  Slot;  Thread diameter.The thread in the exam is pre-determined: M1. We also know the dimensions of the outer and inner hub, and the slot that will be in the exam. All other dimensions will be picked randomly by the examiner. The diameter and length of the pivot also used to be the same for previous exams, but we don’t know if this is still the case.The tolerances in the exam will be more lenient than what we are working to now.We start the exam with 2 mm diameter stock, minimum 25 mm in length.Functionality  Is the winding stem complete?  Is the winding stem in tact?TuesdayI’ve annotated the ETA 6498 (also W-01) winding stem diagram with all the steps I need to take:I’ve broken another winding stem whilst trying to cut the slot. Possible reasons:  slotting tool needed sharpening  hardened to beyond cherry red?  tempered too quickly (soft skin, hard inner)  wrong centre height?I practised cutting slots for the rest of the day and tried the following:  sharpened tool  sat down for better centre height view (instead of standing above the work)  hardened to cherry red, tempered slowly to dark blue properlyThe tool gets blunt quite quickly:The practice was more successful:WednesdayStarted a new winding stem.

First project was a simple filing button: a thin piece of round steel with a hole in the middle, used for filing the square on a winding stem in the lathe, in order to protect the collet and keep a reference flat side.The button is centre pipped and drilled:The button is then parted off with the parting off graver, at slow speed with oil:FridayNext Schaublin project is the barrel closing tool made in acetal. I completed the base today. We’ll work on the cover next week.I finished turning the point on my winding stem. The finishing was very poor – this area needs work. I tested the completed stem in an ETA 6498 and it all worked correctly: winding, setting, etc.We were informed of our final exam dates: November 30, December 1 &amp; 2 2022.Tired Eyes and StretchesNew guides on tired eyes and body stretches – both very important whilst working at the bench for long periods of time:\tTired Eyes guide\tStretches guideWeekly Readings  Jesus said to his disciples: ‘Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and woodworms destroy them and thieves can break in and steal. But store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither moth nor woodworms destroy them and thieves cannot break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  ‘The lamp of the body is the eye. It follows that if your eye is sound, your whole body will be filled with light. But if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be all darkness. If then, the light inside you is darkness, what darkness that will be!’  Matthew 6:19-23  I am the light of the world, says the Lord;anyone who follows me will have the light of life.  John 8:12",

It contains the Truth applicable to all and will be an indispensable resource to the reader.\tDifficult Tasks guide\tGood Works guide\tHumility guide\tObedience guideWeekly ReadingsI will plant a shoot on the high mountain of Israel.  The Lord says this:  ‘From the top of the cedar,from the highest branch I will take a shootand plant it myself on a very high mountain.I will plant it on the high mountain of Israel.It will sprout branches and bear fruit,and become a noble cedar.Every kind of bird will live beneath it,every winged creature rest in the shade of its branches.And every tree of the field will learn that I, the Lord, am the onewho stunts tall trees and makes the low ones grow,who withers green trees and makes the withered green.I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.’  Ezekiel 17:22-24The kingdom of God is a mustard seed growing into the biggest shrub of all.  Jesus said to the crowds: ‘This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man throws seed on the land. Night and day, while he sleeps, when he is awake, the seed is sprouting and growing; how, he does not know. Of its own accord the land produces first the shoot, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. And when the crop is ready, he loses no time: he starts to reap because the harvest has come.’  He also said, ‘What can we say the kingdom of God is like? What parable can we find for it? It is like a mustard seed which at the time of its sowing in the soil is the smallest of all the seeds on earth; yet once it is sown it grows into the biggest shrub of them all and puts out big branches so that the birds of the air can shelter in its shade.’  Using many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, so far as they were capable of understanding it. He would not speak to them except in parables, but he explained everything to his disciples when they were alone.  Mark 4:26-34",

First, we polished about 15mm of the cutting side of the graver on an Arkansas stone, ready for sharpening the diamond shapes later this week.Tuesday &amp; WednesdayWe began sharpening the diamond side of the gravers on India stones and then polishing on Arkansas stone. This is by far the most tedious part of the course so far. You need to hold the graver very tightly in your fingers, lock your wrist, and move from your elbow only. All this is required to have a symmetrical, flat, and correctly angled diamond face.We finished sharpening most of the gravers on Wednesday and started practicing turning in brass.ThursdayMore practice turning in brass. I turned three component holders tools for my project watch, used for graining:  I, setting wheels  II, hour wheel  III, minute wheel  IIII, canon pinion tip  IIIII, crown wheelThe tools are marked with corresponding dashes to know which one is which. The components friction fit onto the rods, and are rotated in the lathe. A polishing compound such as green 3M paper on peg wood is pressed onto the component, and a circular graining is applied.After lunch, we moved onto turning in steel. This has a very different feeling to brass, and blunts the gravers a lot quicker, requiring sharpening and polishing more often.FridayWe continued practicing turning in steel, this time focusing on turning to dimension shoulders and points.We finished the day by installing new Waldmann Taneo LED bench lamps, working on project watch designs, and discussing the moral implications of the story portrayed in the 1969 film Kes.Project Watch: Setting Lever Jumper JigWhilst working on the setting lever jumper this week, I broke off the jumper arm during polishing on grey 3M paper when removing black soot after hardening. I need to start again on this. This time, I will make a simple polishing jig for holding this component. So far, I used my finger to hold the component flat, resulting in uneven polishing and eventually a broken jumper arm.The part will be secured by a screw, and four posts: two large for the body, and two small for keeping the jumper arm still. The aim is to have a way of holding the component flat during polishing and at the end, straight graining.I’ll focus on finishing the yoke next week, and making the jig. I’m able to do a lot more now, that we have access to our 8mm lathes. I’ll practice circular graining the motion work wheels, and possibly finishing some of them at the end of the week.",

Filed the anvil and pusher box lid to upper tolerance before 12pm. Broke a 0.9mm tungsten drill but managed to get it out. Marked the side quite deep when zeroing on the side with a milling cutter using a thin paper (when slowly getting closer with the cutter, turning it by hand back and forth, the paper should move and at that point we zero the DRO – the paper didn’t move and the cutter bit into the work). Additionally, I added the wrong paper thickness when zeroing (added 0.1 instead of 0.01). Nothing else went wrong that I was aware of – finished the project after 4pm.ThursdayI improved the hardening and tempering of the setting lever jumper method, without warping. The key was to wrap the component a lot more tightly around the plate with the iron binding wire. Also had to ensure beforehand, that the angle of the jumper paw itself is correct – only then do I harden it.Tempering was more difficult because of the odd shape of the piece. I heated up a brass plate and carefully, with tweezers, I placed different parts of the setting lever jumper on the plate. The goal was a purple-blue colour, which I was able to achieve on the jumper arm but not quite on the body. Nevertheless, I have a method for hardening and tempering this component. The key is slow, patient work.I received my results from the box lid exam: 90%. The mistakes were:  frosting effect around edges because of straight graining on 180 grit sand paper;  milling cutter zeroing mark;  no burrs which is good, but the bevels were sharp;  inconsistent finishing on bottom of one leg;  the center holes were off-center, because I added the zeroing paper-thickness incorrectly.Did further bevelling practice on the dynamic poising support. Later, I marked out the four slots and started sawing them.FridayWe spent the day servicing our 8mm Horia motor and hand lathes, as well as the hand wheels.We will be sharpening gravers next week.During lunch I filed the final setting lever jumper to shape. I should have the piece finished some time next week.Project Watch: Yoke and Yoke SpringI can’t come up with an aesthetically pleasing design of a yoke and yoke spring in-one for the ETA 6498-1. The boot end of the yoke always looks too large in my Photoshop designs. Because of this, I decided to have two separate components: the yoke and a traditional yoke spring. The yoke will be held down by a screw, around which it will pivot. The yoke spring will consist of a screw and at least one pin. Something like this comes to mind:I will use the existing yoke from the 6498-1 calibre and finish it with bevelling and straight graining. The traditional yoke spring will need to be designed and manufactured from scratch. Both operations require drilling and tapping holes in the base plate for the screws.",

We cut the stock, and discussed how the legs will be pushed in with a staking tool. This week we’ll make practice pieces of this to be read for the 8 hour exam next Wednesday.I will be reworking the keyless works in the ETA 6498-based project watch. For this I needed a technique for cutting out components such as the click spring and springs in general. I thought I’d have to resort to filing all of it to shape by hand but the tutor recommended a book which describes the grinding technique. This is: a rotating grinding disk is attached to a lathe, with a support, the piece is held flat and ground to shape.\t\tTwenty-First Century Watchmaking, Book One by William O. Smith, AWI PressDiscussed the dial side of the project watch with the tutor: keyless works and chapter ring.

We watched these videos on the topic:  Blancpain Tourbillon vs. Carrousel  Summary: BLANCPAIN - the difference between a tourbillon and a carrousel explained by Jeff Kingston  The Art of Tourbillon &amp; Carrousel in Watchmaking – Chronometry SagaContinued filing the anvil box lid. At lunch, I relaxed (heated to cherry red and let it cool off by itself) the setting lever jumper and filed it roughly to shape.I made a big nick in the lower part of the jumper itself but now I know that filing it to shape doesn’t take too long, just need a good way of holding it. In my case it was in the jaws of a steel vice. Later that week I covered the steel jaws with a thin sheet of brass and hammered it to shape to protect any future work.We got results for our marked sawing support project. I got joint highest in class: 93%. I lost marks on the edges in the “V” cutout and corners in two other spots.ThursdayFinished the practice anvil box lid piece. Filed to size, drilled, and pushed in the legs.Tried hardening the setting lever jumper prototype, bound in iron wire. It broke at the area where I made the accidental nick. Next step is to make two steel plates that screw together, which will hold the piece flat during hardening.FridayCompleted another anvil and pusher box lid from start to finish. Much more confident for the exam. I’ll be making a step-by-step plan for the exam over the weekend.I started planning the steps I’ll need to look at for the project watch. Each component that needs work is listed, with statuses for each and the next steps. We haven’t worked on the lathes yet, so I marked which step requires a lathe and which doesn’t. All self explanatory. Still a work in progress.",

I want to improve the setting lever jumper and the yoke/yoke spring components.Setting lever jumperThe setting lever jumper in the Dufour Simplicity is where my inspiration lies, from both the finishing point of view and the shape design of the component itself:Drafting and functionalityFor drafting, I used Photoshop. I got the setting lever jumper component design from ETA, placed it as the background, used the magic wand and bucket tool to have a layer to shape using the eraser tool.Draft #1I’m happy with the first draft. I like the light contours. Whilst erasing the original layer, I kept in mind the functionality of each piece of the component. For example, I kept the area over the yoke which helps keep it down. The area over the motion work wheels was also kept as to keep them down. I added two inspection holes.Draft #2The second draft is an alternative to #1, in case the area around the yoke is not strong enough to hold it down. In #2 I keep the area which wraps around the yoke hole. This is my least favourite design of the three – I failed to keep the nice proportions and the modified yoke area is ugly.Draft #3For this final draft, I took into account the fact that I can modify the yoke/yoke spring components so that they are one, and held by a screw – a bit like these pocket watch Patek and Vacheron keyless works:The design omits the area around the yoke spring as it would be held down by a screw and not the setting lever jumper plate above.This design is my favourite of the three. I wanted to modify the yoke and yoke spring anyway.Yoke and yoke springAs per above examples from Patek and Vacheron, I want the two components (yoke and yoke spring) as one. I can see the possibility of either modifying an existing yoke to turn it into a spring, or creating a new component based on the existing yoke. I’m leaning towards making a new component because the area left by the yoke spring might look out of place and lack proportion.I will discuss the options with my tutor next week, but after trying to draft the yoke from the existing component in Photoshop I found the end result poor in balance and ugly. I think I will need to fashion a new component altogether for the yoke and yoke spring union.",

The brass cube was signed off but I started on a steel cube in order to challenge myself.Tried bluing black polished screws using the screw bluing plate I made last week. I forgot to clean the screws after they’ve been sitting in my drawer for a week. The bluing results were poor because of lack of cleanliness.We were informed of exam dates, which are as follows this year:  12 May, anvil box lid  28 July, winding stem  29 September, balance staff  8 December, gear trainAnd these in 2022:  3 February, escapement  18–19 May, hairspring  final exam date to be announcedWednesdayContinued with the steel cube. Difficult to describe but achieving flatness is harder than with brass.Milled, drilled, and tapped sawing support bottom part.ThursdayFinished steel cube. The flatness and squareness were good but I ran out of tolerance to give the steel cube a nice straight brushed finish. If I were to attempt the cube the third time I’d know how to reconcile tolerance/dimensions, flatness, squareness, and finish. The project, seemingly pointless, benefited my dexterity and patience.The countersink tool for the mill arrived, and I was able to countersink the sawing support top.At the end of the day, we discussed project watches, specifically the click spring. From this discussion I wrote up initial ideas and notes.FridayCut stock and filed dynamic poising support tool.Straight-grained the sawing support elements but still need to finish to tolerance.After school on Thursday I created a milling machine controls poster as I kept getting confused as to which way to turn the X, Y, Z axis and which digital readout buttons to press for which axis. I will get this printed, laminated, and placed beside the milling machine.It seems that this isn’t just my forgetting, but this confusion takes place in people who haven’t used the machine for a while.

If for some reason I’m not able to finish the movement side I can always install a solid case back, etc.The movement I will be working off of is the ETA 6498-1.PlatingThe entire brass movement will have a rose gold plating, that is: base plate, three-quarter plate, balance cock, pallet bridge.Dial sideDesignOpen dial design showing the base plate directly, with a brushed steel chapter ring for the hour/minute track with drilled dots for each index.

Some theory on hardening/tempering, surface finish, and grinding/sharpening principles.MondayFinished drilling anvil and pusher box base.Continued practicing black polishing. I tried cutting down on the number of steps of papers and pastes I used, so now to black polish I use: blue 3M (9 micron), pink 3M (3 micron), 1.5 micron paste, 0.5 micron paste.I got started on the flat brass lap and finished it first thing Tuesday.TuesdayThe brass scraper tool with a 30 degree angle was difficult at first. To get the angle right was tricky. It took me all of Tuesday and beginning of Wednesday to get it complete.WednesdaySome theory and demo today. We learned about hardening and tempering, surface finish principles, grinding and sharpening principles.I started the steel 3 sided cutter/scriber. The scriber part needed to be 30 degrees and was reasonably easy to achieve – I did this last. The 3 sided cutter part was harder and I needed to start again. The key was to mark out an equilateral triangle on a flat face and file equally on all three sides until you got a point. Then it is a matter of ensuring flatness, removal of facets, and centering of the sharp point tip itself.A method I learned in a book was to use french chalk on the files in order to avoid clogging. The file is run across a french chalk block. The method worked well and clogging was reduced and the cutting was smoother.ThursdayI finished the 3 sided cutter/scriber in the morning.I then hardened, polished, and tempered the tool to a blue color. I applied polishing tape to the ends of the blued surface and polished so that the blued ends were even.Began work on the brass sawing support by milling and drilling the two holes.

Milled the base of an anvil and pusher box also in Acetal.MondayBack from Easter holidays.Started working on a filing support tool that we will use later for filing winding stems. The material used is called Acetal – a sort of white plastic combining low-friction and high-wear resistance.Tuesday &amp; WednesdayStarted practicing black polishing on bridge screws, using the bolt tool I made, along with 3M lapping papers and diamond lapping pastes on a zinc block.We were told that everyone will work out their own method but that the idea is the same: polish flat on less and less coarse laps and pastes until you see no scratches and see a black polished surface. The method that worked for me was: start off with blue 3M lapping film (9 micron) on a glass sheet to ground the screw level, then move on to the pink 3M 3 micron film and then the yellow-green 3M 1 micron film. Clean thoroughly and move onto the zinc block with three pastes: 3.5 micron, 1.5 micron, and 0.5 micron. I’m aware that I’m overlapping the micron counts but this is what worked for me. Films and pastes give different finishes even if they state to be the same micron count.Cleanliness is the most important and time consuming when black polishing. I came up with a method for cleaning that worked better than Rodico dabbing and ultra sonic machine cleaning. I used pith wood dabbed in isopropanol which I slid across the surface of the screw in the direction of the slot. Each slide I used a different side of the piece of pith wood. Beforehand I gave it a light brushing with iso in a glass jar. It was then that I moved onto pith which gave it the final finish without having to run to the ultra sonic tank for every screw.ThursdayIt took about one and a half days to successfully polish one screw. I dropped my first black polished bridge screw so the first successful screw was the setting lever screw.For a while I moved onto two other projects to have a rest from black polishing.I filed two 20mm tall cylindrical laps in 21mm and 6mm diameters. These will be used for sticking lapping film on their sides, and running bridge sides around them to polish flanks. The bottom surface of the lap needed to be filed by hand and as close to perfect 90 degrees throughout. The smaller lap was much easier than the larger.Next I cut the stock in Acetal for an anvil and pusher box base project.FridayContinued black polishing but this time tried bevelling the edge of the screw and its slot. The edge I bevelled using a burr tool which gave a quite rough finish – this will be finished more smoothly on a lathe with a flat lap. The screw slot I bevelled with a triangular Degussit stone. Again, the finish as quite rough and hard to get consistent.At the end of the day I milled the anvil and pusher box, ready for drilling the holes next week.",

Afterwards, we got a presentation on cleaning and on lubrication.TuesdayStep by step lubrication demonstration whilst we follow along on the 6498.First, practiced oiling the balance end cap jewels. Below is an example of one with slightly too little oil:Then we moved onto the train bridge jewels.Before assembling and oiling the escapement we treated the escape wheel with a surface tensioner called Epilam (or Fixodrop). The escape wheel was put into a pea basket, put into this special jar and turned upside down for a few minutes. Then, swiftly, it was taken out and dried with a hair drier to dry it and also “bake” it.The pallet jewels were treated differently: using a pipette, only the jewels themselves were submerged inside the Epilam solution, and then dried and baked with a hair drier (with caution: as if heated too much the shellac holding the pallets might melt).We then moved onto oiling the escapement using this method: with the balance taken out, a light wind in the barrel, under the microscope, apply oil to the escape wheel tooth, using a peg move the pallet fork twice, apply again, and do this until you see the firstly oiled tooth at the top. Run through a few times and check the amount applied. The microscope was very useful for this, just need to get used to the depth of vision.After oiling everything else, we placed the movements on the Witschi Watch Expert III timing machine and had a go at adjusting the beat error and timing.

Image looks wobbly, but the piece is as true and flat as is possible with only hand tools.In the afternoon we got a demonstration of tapping holes.Later I marked out the rear holes for the feet using a height gauge, ready for drilling and tapping tomorrow morning. The front holes need marking, drilling, and tapping this week as well.TuesdayI drilled two rear holes, and two front blind holes on the bolt tool blank:  Center the drill on the previously marked points;  Using center drill, make center pips;  Using helix drill (diameter 2 mm), drill all the way through;  Using square-end milling drill (d. 2.5 mm) open up the two holes further.The two front blind holes:  Use center drill on marked points;  Using helix drill (d. 2 mm), drill 6.5mm deep.The rear holes I tapped.I then gave it a light countersink to get rid of burrs.In the afternoon, we got a demonstration of using the milling cutter to mill the two inner faces of the cut two-piece bolt tool. This I cut next, using a piercing saw.We also set up a Leica microscope. I tested it on a Reverso.WednesdayIn the morning, I milled the two inner faces of the bolt tool using a 6 mm carbide square end mill, drilled two blind holes in the main body and tapped them. For drilling the two blind holes I used this sequence of steps:  Use 6 mm carbide square end mill to zero the work on the edge of the plate by zeroing as soon as the drill touched the sides (done in 0.1 mm increments until contact);  Use 3-sided cutter for center pips;  Use 1.6 mm carbide drill, drilling 6 mm deep.The last step required a lot of patience and delicate touch. Drilling that deep with a very fragile carbide cutter requires you to drill very slowly and lightly, whilst pulling up the drill to let it cool and removing any swarf. A handful of drills of this kind broke inside other student’s work, which is why I was extra careful.Later I cut the side taper and filed the sides. I gave it a preliminary brushed finish.The front piece I milled unknowingly to almost perfectly 5.00 mm as shown on the caliper.ThursdayMilled the front part of the bolt tool and hand-filed the angled sides of the main body.We got a presentation of using the Schaublin 70 to hold our work whilst tapping a small round component (the lock nut and handle for the two rear height adjusters of the bolt tool). I started working on these adjuster parts from raw rod of brass. Filing flat and true a round rod of brass is very difficult.FridayFurther work on the locking nut and screw handle for the bolt tool legs. Filing and drilling. I found a better technique for filing the round rod of brass for the handles: lay file flat next to the side of a vice which makes a 90-degree angle; push the brass rod against the vice flat and drag across the file. This achieves a flat and true surface much quicker than what I was doing on Thursday.We talked further about our personal project ideas and some career options.Clean up, and early finish.",

I finished two file cleaner tools to within ±0.2 mm tolerances, and started working on a bolt tool (polishing jig).MondayFinally back in the building after seven weeks of remote learning using Zoom. We started off with an induction about general health and safety and fire safety. Interesting to note the precautions the school takes in storing chemicals which are in fire-proof locked cabinets with drip trays. The chemicals used for the cleaning machine are particularly dangerous.Next, we picked our benches and vacuumed them. We had to bring all the tools we were given back in January into the school, which all fit in a duffel-bag and were awkward to carry. The tools we brought in and the remainder that stayed in school were all put into the different bench drawers. There was a set of tools that we borrowed from school, which we documented and checked out so that we can return them at the end of the two years. Among them a very nice and rare Luthy tool for vibrating hairsprings; a Horia jewelling set with anvils; a Star/Bergeon staking set; among others. We measured and ordered the anvil set for the Horia tool to make sure it is not damaged and within specification.All the presentations we were given as PDFs during the past two months were given out in printed paper form to put into ring binders.I’m anticipating having a beautiful time at the school for the next two years.TuesdayA presentation on drills and a primer on using the milling machine. We started off with drilling wooden hand files in order to get acquainted with setting up and using the machine.Some notes on setup:  Choose appropriate drill bit – in this case we had to drill two different diameter holes with differing depths to accommodate the specific file tangs which are tapered; these are then hammered down into the wooden handle with a mallet;  Mount the drill bit to the chuck and tighten securely; secure the piece in the bottom vice, remembering to remove the tightening key before continuing;  Center the work piece with the drill bit in X, Y, Z positions (by eye), and reset the readouts on the right; check visually in two planes whilst turning the chuck by hand to ensure the alignment is centered;  Zero the Z axis (the top which holds the chuck) on the top of the work piece so that we can accurately drill the desired depths;  Wear eye protection and start the machine;  Pull the handle on the right down gently and slowly, back out, back down, etc. – take your time and drill slowly;  Turn off machine.Next, we began working on the file cleaner project. A very simple 20 x 50 x 2 mm brass piece for cleaning clogged files. We roughly measured out the piece on a large brass plate, using a black marker and scriber. The piece was cut out with a hack saw, ready for filing.WednesdayMorning presentation on files and filing techniques covering drill types (most common is twist drill, and then center drill which is used for piloting); HSS, tungsten carbide; machine safety; checking drill condition before using (vital for micro-mechanics); drilling techniques and drilling various materials; and finishing drilled holes (taper broaches, reamers, countersinks).For the rest of the day we filed the file cleaner. This means filing a reference side which is fully true, and working on the other three sides from that reference side. We needed to ensure trueness, flatness, right-angles, and keeping in mind the tolerances of ±0.2mm. Today I finished three sides. I’ve left quite a large chunk extra whilst sawing so I have to file down about 5mm of brass – it will take a while. We are collecting the brass shavings to use later when bluing components. I also completed drilling the rest of the file handles.ThursdayMore filing. I completed my first file cleaner to within tolerances, and stamped my initial on it. I stamped further two numbers relating to the coarseness of the file I’ll be using them on. De-burred the edges and finished with a simple graining. Not a perfect finish but good enough since this is a quite crude tool. Next projects will have nicer finishing.The cleaner works very well.In the afternoon I made another cleaner for my 5 and 6 files.Later, we started working on the bolt tool used for black polishing. This is from a much thicker 5 mm brass plate measuring approximately 30 x 40 mm, similar to the Daniels design from his Watchmaking book. Today I got the rough plate cut out and started working on the reference side. Much more difficult to get a flat surface in two planes with this thicker sheet.FridayIn the morning I finished the reference side of my bolt tool, and will be finishing the other three sides next week. Later we got a demonstration of using the milling machine for drilling brass and also got an introduction on taps and dies – both operations we will need for the bolt tool. The catch is that if we break a drill inside the tool, it is almost impossible to get it out, in which case we have to start all over again.In the afternoon we looked at past student projects and looked at some scrap bridges, base plates, etc. that the students practiced on – a finishing that immediately caught my eye was a frosted barrel bridge with rose gold plating, and a base plate with very fine spotting in the recesses.At the end of the day we cleaned the entire workshop by vacuuming, wiping all surfaces, and mopping – with an early finish at 4 PM.",

				"content": "In this final week of remote learning we slowly ran out of material we could cover at home. If we had to continue remote watchmaking school we would have been sent the ETA 7751 early. Fortunately, next week we can get into the building.On Monday we discussed the power reserve complication for someone else’s personal project, then had a look at the ETA 955.112 keyless work to clear up any issues with assembly, and finally for the rest of the day (and the week) we practiced sequential work.Sequential workI’ve never come across this method before. Sequential work usually means working on a handful of movements of the same calibre at once, performing every operation on each in sequence. For example, the movements are each in a movement holder, and their parts are on a white piece of paper with black marker division drawn on. If we are assembling the barrel bridge, we assemble it for each watch before moving on to the next operation. This allows you to compare for example side-shake across the movements and saves you time having to go fetch spare parts if you need to replace the gaskets (which are usually always replaced).",

Earlier in the week we were shown service inspection points on the ETA 6498-1.MondayUsing the ETA 6498-1 for demonstration, we got an overview of how to perform a service inspection whilst disassembling a movement. Writing up a complete list of each individual inspection of every single component would be pointless. Instead, I summarised the inspection points as follows:  Perform initial timing machine test, this will show any obvious faults right away;  Check hairspring for flatness, deformations;  Check end-shake on all pivoted components (balance, pallet fork, gears);  Check pivots for smoothness, damage;  Check wear on acting/contact surfaces;  Check jewel damage, including pallet fork jewels for wear;  Check guard-pin is centred in safety roller;  Escapement: horn clearance, drop, run to banking, guard-pin clearance on both sides, notch condition, escape wheel height in relation to pallet jewel faces (should be in the middle);  Gear train: check gear-pinion meshing in vertical plane is central, check arbor uprightness, teeth profiles from side and top;  Barrel bridge area: check wheel and bridge wear, click wear, underside of crown wheel, check oil shadows;  Keyless works: sliding pinion Breguet teeth engagement and wear, setting mechanism tension, spring tension and condition, check posts, check bushes.References\t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 29—53, 62—80, 81—93, 110—116 (‘Lever Escapement, Examination and Correction’, ‘The Train: Gears and Tooth Forms’, ‘The Barrel and Mainspring’, ‘Keyless Work’)TuesdayWe took a look at the arrangement, function, and adjustment of the gear train. End and side shakes of the wheel pivots was discussed and a Horia tool jewel adjustment demonstrated. When adjusting the gear train we need to take into account the following points:  End and side shake of barrel arbor, barrel complete, and all other wheels;  Check if all components are flat and true;  Teeth condition of all components;  Pivot condition of all components;  Jewel or bearing condition throughout the gear train.Finally, we took a quick look at gear efficiency calculations and formulas for gear train revolutions.References\t\tThe Theory of Horology, 2nd English edition by C.

Same with n regarding the number of revolutions.This allows us to work out answers to questions like these:Given these components: 16 teeth winding pinion, 36 teeth crown wheel, 54 teeth ratchet wheel, 66 teeth barrel. How many turns of the crown are needed to wind the mainspring by 8 turns?The given barrel tooth count is in fact not the last component because by turning the crown we are actually in the end turning the barrel arbor which turns the mainspring. The barrel itself, for all intents and purposes, stays stationary because it dissipates energy so slowly. So if turns of the crown are x, we solve for:      8    x    =      16    54    x  =  27Given these components: 48 teeth minute wheel, 12 leafs minute wheel pinion, 36 teeth hour wheel.

				"content": "In the first week we got an overview of the toolkit we purchased for the course, calibration techniques for the vernier caliper and micrometer, screwdriver blade making and sharpening, ETA 6498-1 disassembly and assembly, uncasing, screw identification, keyless works theory, and discussion of personal project ideas.MondayOur first remote lesson was a run-through of all the tools we purchased as part of our toolkit, a guide on how to calibrate a caliper and a micrometer, and a look-through an ETA 2824-2 technical communication document.CalibrationAs part of the toolkit we received a TESA CCMA-M 0.02 MM dial vernier caliper and a TESA ISOMASTER AA 0-25 external micrometer. Both came in a single black Bergeon-branded wooden box. We calibrated them roughly in the zero-position, that is without a reference gauge. If we were using a reference gauge we would need to ensure as far as possible, the temperature between the tool and reference gauge to be the same.Before calibrating either of the measuring tools, ensure the measuring faces are clean of any dirt by squeezing a piece of clean white paper between the faces and sliding it out. You will see any dirt on the paper.After cleaning the surfaces, to calibrate the vernier caliper unscrew lightly the bottom silver screw underneath the dial. Whilst the faces are touching in the zero-position, rotate the dial until it is pointing to exactly zero, and screw the silver screw all the way.As with the caliper, carefully clean the measuring faces of the micrometer as well as the free part of the spindle. Close measuring faces while turning the spindle slowly and evenly using friction drive. Fix spindle with the aid of the locking lever.For small deviations of reading on the micrometer, turn the barrel to the correct position by means of forwarded setting key. This requires quite a lot of force and grip.In order to ensure reliable repeatability of the values, measurement should always be performed with the friction drive function.General remarksEye loupes tend to fog up depending on the temperature of the workshop and your body. A simple solution to this is drilling holes in the side of your loupe.Sometimes brand-new eye loupes have rough edges from the plastic moulding. You can run the edges on an Arkansas stone to smooth them in order to avoid irritation around the eye.Always put components under covers on your bench.Black bench mats are good in particular for encasing as you can see lint, fibres, etc. on the dark background.Regarding movement holders, always check all four sides are gripping the movement securely. Nicer quality holder like the Bergeon ones we have tend to have inward angled edges which grip the movement further down to avoid it popping up when pressure is applied. Plastic movement holders tend to wear out quicker than metal ones and also not grip as good.References\t\tWatchmaking, 2011 revision by George Daniels, PWP, p. 1—50 (‘Workshop and Equipment’, ‘Hand Tools’)\t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 1—11 (‘Workshop and Work-Bench’, ‘Essential Tools’)\t\tThe Watch Repairer’s Manual, 2nd edition by Henry B. Fried, Martino Fine Books, p. 257 (‘How To Read a Micrometer’)TuesdayTo practice measuring and filing, we next had to accurately measure three different (green 2mm, pink 1.6mm, red 1.2mm) Bergeon screwdriver blades, produce working drawings for each, and reproduce three of each from brass rods.We used brass rods, pin vices, a pillar file, a square file, and India and Arkansas stones for sharpening the blades themselves. For marking out I used a black felt tip, and marked lines in the ink using a caliper.  Cut the brass rod to the correct length using the square file;  File flat both ends and remove burrs;  Mark out the rear notch part;  Using the pillar file, file the rear notch whilst checking every so often to ensure the correct depth of the notch;  Ensure the notch has a downward taper from the rear so that the retaining screw in the screwdriver handle grips the blade;  Remove burrs, insert into screwdriver handle, and put the handle in the screwdriver sharpener;  Sharpen the blade on the India stone.I found that with the non-Swiss screwdriver sharpener, I couldn’t get the screwdriver handle past the grip (be it knurled or the black plastic kind) into the hole of the sharpener for handles 140 and up. This resulted in blade ends not having as long a taper as I’d like them to, however they are still technically functional.If we attended an assessment day (which was done online this year), one of the tasks would have been to file a flat on a short brass rod and make it stand by itself on the desk. This is more difficult than it sounds, using only a pillar file and a pin vice.References\t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 5—11 (‘Essential Tools’)WednesdayNext, we began disassembling the ETA 6498-1 movement whilst getting an overview of what the different components do and how they interact. First, we adjusted the screwdriver blades we made to fit the screws on the case and movement:  The blades of the screwdrivers should receive constant attention. The business end must be shaped, not to a knife edge, but with an edge (…) The taper of the blade should be reasonably long so that when it is inserted in the slot of a screw it will not, when a little pressure is exerted either to unscrew or screw up, have the tendency to slip out of the slot and so maul the screw head.  \t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 5  A carelessly used screwdriver can cause marks and scratches on the watch plates, and badly sharpened blades can damage the screw heads. The blade must be pressed firmly down into the screw-head slot before the screwdriver is rotated, and if increase in the turning pressure is necessary the downward pressure must be proportionally increased.  The fit of the blade into the slot is important if the screwdriver is to be used deftly and with confidence. A correctly shaped blade fitting into a good slot is shown in Fig 21. Note that the flat edge of the blade does not reach the bottom of the slot and so cannot skid out sideways and the sides cannot mark the visible edge of the slot.  \t\tWatchmaking, 2011 revision by George Daniels, PWP, p. 31—32 (‘Screwdrivers’)We were shown the correct procedure to remove the bezel of the case and the correct way of handling the different components with attention given to springs, etc.References\t\tWatchmaking, 2011 revision by George Daniels, PWP, p. 31 (‘Tweezers’, ‘Screwdrivers’)\t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 12—28 (‘Case, Dial and Hands’, ‘The Movement, Components and Dismantling’)\t\tThe Watch Repairer’s Manual, 2nd edition by Henry B. Fried, Martino Fine Books, p. 1—28 (‘The Modern Watch’, ‘Cleaning and Overhauling a Watch Movement’)ThursdayWe assembled the ETA 6498-1 movement again, however left the last step of casing until we come back to school. It became apparent that the ETA technical communication document for the movement doesn’t always present the order of assembly in the actually correct order. We were told not to blindly follow the manual, but to think ahead. For example, the manual tells us to place the canon pinion and hour wheel in place, before we even assembled the centre wheel and its surrounding parts, etc. The manuals are very important for lubrication points, which means you should always have the most up-to-date version.ReferencesThough we haven’t looked at inspection or fault identification at all yet, we talked about checking back-wind on the gear train:  If the train is perfectly free and you allow it to run down after winding the mainspring a little, the train should reverse its motion at the very end of the mainspring. In other words, before the escape wheel stops it should run backwards for perhaps one revolution or two. This is due to the rebound when the eye of the mainspring butts on the hook of the barrel arbor. It is perhaps a crude test, but it forms a general indication that all is well with the freedom of the train.  \t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 62—63We paid attention to screw identification which reminded me of Fried’s “Various Types of Watch Screws” chapter:  Simple as they are individually, the varied assortment of screws used in a watch are one of the most complex facets of the watchmakers’ trade.  One of the most paradoxical branches of watchmaking centers around watch screws. No universal agreement exists on thread size, pitch, design or thread direction.  In one watch, one may find as many as four different kinds of bride screws, ratchet and crown wheel screws with different thread direction, cap and jewel screws of various thicknesses and lengths, some with polished heads, others with unpolished heads but polished thread ends and other differences.  \t\tBench Practices for Watch Repairers, 2018 reprint by Henry B. Fried, Martino Fine Books, p. 92—107FridayWe covered theory of the keyless works, discussed personal project ideas, and got an overview of finishing techniques.Keyless works  The first watches were wound and set by a separate loose key. A common arrangement was for the mainspring to be wound from the back and the hands set from the front.  Using a key to wind and set a watch has numerous disadvantages: the key can get lost, the hole in the case back lets in dust, and the dial or hands can easily be damaged during setting.  To overcome these problems mechanisms were invented that allowed the watch to be wound and set using a button or crown on the end of the pendant, the tube that projects from the side of the case and carries the bow.  — SourceOne of the historical mechanisms we covered was the rocking bar system:  The rocking bar mechanism, shown in the image here, uses a bar with with a central wheel that can be turned by turning the crown, and wheels mounted on both ends. The wheels on the ends engage with either the winding or setting mechanism, in the normal position the winding mode is engaged. The bar is rocked to change the mechanism from the winding to hand setting mode.  — SourceWe also discussed the negative set system which is well described in this article.Finally, we discussed the modern style keyless works, described in the following books:\t\tThe Theory of Horology, 2nd English edition by C. Reymondin, G. Monnier, D. Jeanneret, U. Pelaratti, The Technical College of the Vallee De Joux, p. 37, 40—42 (‘Winding and setting the hands’)\t\tWatchmaking, 2011 revision by George Daniels, PWP, p. 272—273 (‘Winding’)\t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 110—116 (‘Keyless Work’)\t\tThe Watch Repairer’s Manual, 2nd edition by Henry B. Fried, Martino Fine Books, p. 15—17 (‘The Dial Train’, ‘The Setting Mechanism’)The terminology WOSTEP requires us to use is the one found in ETA technical communication documents:Finishing techniquesThe finishing techniques we will be required to complete and be assessed on are (in suggested order of completion): sand/bead blasting, circular graining/spinning, dressing flanks, straight graining, cutting countersinks, polishing countersinks, perlage/spotting, frosting, Côtes de Genève, pin stripes, bevelling, snailing, black polishing, bluing, pantograve.",
				"excerpt": "In the first week we got an overview of the toolkit we purchased for the course, calibration techniques for the vernier caliper and micrometer, screwdriver blade making and sharpening, ETA 6498-1 disassembly and assembly, uncasing, screw identification, keyless works theory, and discussion of personal project ideas."

				"content": "I was set to begin the 3000-hour WOSTEP course this week but due to strict state restrictions the school has closed until further notice. For the time being, we are planning on focusing on theory and basic movement disassembly at home. The portable watchmaker’s bench I made will be of much use.Remote learning toolkit contentsI have picked up the following list of toolkit items from the school in preparation for remote study starting next week. Some of the items seem to be available only for schools and cannot be bought online in the sets we got (e.g. set of tweezers of the kind described below). It appears that items with the code SPEC in their item number refer to non-standard Bergeon part numbers which are part of the WOSTEP toolkit.  Bergeon 30081-S09 turning stand with 9 screwdrivers;  Bergeon set of 8 tweezers and hairspring cutters in black wooden box: brass 74-22-PM-S5, superalloy AA 7028-2/4/5, plastic tip steel AA 6571-CFR-00 and 6571-D-SPEC, hairspring cutters 7027-15A, and steel angled AA 7026-6;  Bergeon 30026-A assortment of 5 round-headed pin vices in black wooden box;  Bergeon 66500-161-SPEC, 66500-174-SPEC, 66500-163-SPEC set of 3 magnifying loupes;  Bergeon 5461 set of 3 wire loupe holders;  Bergeon 4039 small movement holder;  Bergeon 4040 movement holder;  Bergeon 5394-P casing gel;  Bergeon 30019 pair of fine hand levers;  Bergeon 7404 set of 3 hand fitting tools;  Bergeon 30097-BC cover and tray with 6 compartments, unbreakable;  Bergeon 5733 bellows;  Bergeon 4125 Arkansas and India stones in black wooden box;  Bergeon 30451-150I 15cm steel ruler;  Bergeon 10725-SPEC Tesa 150mm Calipers, 0.02mm; 11360-SPEC Tesa ISO Master 0-25mm micrometer in black wooden box.Not part of the official toolkit itself are some items we borrowed from school just for remote learning:  Bergeon 7808-N soft mat;  Generic screw driver sharpener;  White wide plastic tweezers;  Swiss case opening tool;  Bergeon 7033-1 premium Rodico;  Push hand remover tool;  Cannon pinion remover tool;  Plastic, thin round wooden, thick round wooden pegs;  Square needle file;  Flat needle file;  Tool tray;  Brass wire.Additionally we received scrap and training movements sorted into three boxes:Quartz  Encased ETA white-dial watch with ETA 955-112 quartz movement;  ETA 955.112 quartz movement;  Tag Heuer ETA 955.112 quartz movement and red dial.Automatic  Encased ETA black-dial watch with ETA 2824-2 automatic movement;  Two Tissot ETA 2824-2 automatic movements.Manual  Two encased ETA white-dial watches with ETA 6498-2 manual movements.Finally we received five service manuals for the following movements:  ETA 955.112 quartz;  ETA 6497-2 / 6498-2 manual;  ETA 2824-2 automatic;  ETA 2892A2 automatic;  ETA 7751 automatic chronograph with month, day, and moonphase.The rest of the toolkit (larger tools and files, etc.) has been left at school.ProceedingDuring a phone call with the school I was told that usually we’d start with the micro-mechanics module but due to the current situation, we will be focusing on theory and basic disassembly from home. The new format of the WOSTEP 3000-hour course coincides with the 1800-hour course so we will begin by covering the modules that both courses contain. I was told the course curriculum was re-written to be more up-to-date, as the previous curriculum was almost twenty years old.WOSTEP W-01We spoke about the WOSTEP W-01 calibre. The W-01 is an ébauche movement which we will need to jewel, decorate, make a balance staff for, spring, and adjust. We have the possibility of sending the finished movement to Switzerland for COSC certification. If it passes the test we will receive case, dial, and hands from the school gratis to encase the watch and keep it. If it doesn’t pass the certification it cannot leave the school without being encased — in this case we will need to pay for the case, dial, and hands ourselves. I’ve been told that sometimes students are disappointed because their movements don’t pass the COSC tests even though they were well within the accuracy limits before being sent off by courier to Switzerland — in other words, we will need to rely on the delicacy of the courier.Personal projectDuring the call we discussed ideas for a personal project which I will be able to work on given I am not behind on the mandatory course work. I believe the project needs to be based on the ETA 6498 movement. At this stage, I expressed I want the project to be focusing on excellent finishing and one simple complication, namely the moonphase. I’d rather make a simple piece to the best of my abilities, than a complex piece badly.I’ve composed an initial ideas collage (draft) containing some of the features I’d like my personal project to encompass. It is a little ambitious at the moment — I’ll most likely get a better picture of what’s possible with the tools we have and the time at our disposal.",

				"title": "DIY Portable Watchmaker&apos;s Bench",
				"content": "  To sum up: Banish damp, dirt, draughts and distraction. Encourage comfort, warmth, quiet. Provide good light, good ventilation, good tools and a liberal supply of materials. Good and profitable work should result.  Although I am going to describe working conditions of an ideal character, it does not prevent the beginner from making a start in a simple way. But do not think that any good can come of trying to do work on the corner of an odd table. Take the job seriously and at least fit up a shelf to serve as a bench.  \t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 3Soon after deciding that watchmaking is what I wanted to devote my time to, I started buying tools and setting up a temporary work space. I followed de Carle’s advice and took the job seriously: I made a portable watchmaker’s work bench to place on top of my regular desk. I decided on going the DIY route for three reasons: the cost of buying a ready-made bench was too high (see Horotec or Bergeon portable benches); I could make the bench with custom dimensions so that it fit in my environment; and I had the satisfaction of making something myself based on a design and material of my choice.My design is basically a box without a bottom. Through this simple design I saved a lot of money compared to buying a ready-made bench. Sure: my design doesn’t have arm rests. But as I said, it is temporary and provides sufficient utility. It is similar to the benches in Roger W. Smith’s workshop, but more adapted for my limited desk space:PrerequisitesI chose American Oak timber for the sides (purchased from a local DIY store) and an off-cut of generic oak from eBay for the top. First find the top that fits your specification and buy the timber for the sides to fit. Ensure sufficient height of the sides. The total height of the bench is about 215mm which, when placed on my desk, makes it 955mm from the floor. Calculate the ideal height of the bench based on your own height, the location where you’ll place it, and on how low your chair goes. Donald de Carle suggests 36 to 38 inches from the floor (that is 91.44cm to 96.52cm). Ensure the top provides sufficient length to rest the elbows while at work.I chose oak because of its rigidity and hardness. This meant sawing it was quite difficult as it is such a dense wood. The result however, was satisfying as the bench is very solid and heavy. It will no doubt last for a long time.The timber I chose for the sides was not completely flat and I did not have the tools to plane it. I still constructed the bench, but any gaps I filled with multi-purpose wood filler. I did not use any special joints. I attached everything with wood adhesive, screws, and inside I used right-angled corner mounting brackets with screws. On the screw slots I used a countersink drill bit so that the heads were flush (or slightly more than flush so that they could be filled with wood filler).I sanded everything by hand using sandpaper wrapped around a cork sanding block. I focused most on the top surface to give it a very smooth almost glossy finish. I used yacht varnish on all sides except the top which I wanted to keep raw. After the varnish dried, I mounted on a self-adhesive Bergeon 6808-B work mat.3D modelThe below model is an approximation of what I constructed, with some improvement which I did not have the chance to implement (namely, wooden right-angled corner mounting brackets instead of plastic ones I used, and increased edge curves on the work-top).You may use the “Measure” tool to get all the measurements. Use the “Explode Model” slider to see all the different parts.",

				"title": "Preparing For Watchmaking School",
				"content": "I believe I got into watchmaking school without much trouble because I was prepared and passionate. The global situation which forced the interview process to be conducted entirely online might have also been a factor.Before I applied I wanted to build up any experience with watches that would be good enough to include in my application cover letter. And so I went out and bought a bunch of Donald de Carle, Henry B. Fried, and George Daniels books and studied them. At a certain point in the books one gets stuck due to lack of tools: in my case it was mainspring winders which were too expensive, and a lathe which was too risky to buy without the experience of ever using or buying one. Lack of a dedicated workshop space was also an issue.Working on scrap movementsHowever, there is plenty to do without expensive tools. I started with deconstructing two manual-wind hour, minute, central seconds movements (Citizen 0201). Working on something I didn’t mind ruining gave me confidence to work on something nicer. On eBay, I bought a handful of vintage Swiss mechanical movements from de-cased watches. These included ladies-sized movements (variants of the AS 1012), one pin-pallet escapement which I’ve never seen before (see chapter 6 of Practical Watch Repair), among others:There were also some nicer movements which I plan to work on during school. Namely, a Longines L817.4 with the original gold-tone dial and hands, a great condition ladies Certina 13-20 with a like-new dial, a men’s Certina 25-661 with date, and lastly a very nice Garrard with a beautiful cream dial with blued-steel hands (which I hope to encase at some point):These watches were more than enough to practice and experiment on. I started with the ladies AS 1012 variants. This in my opinion is better than starting on pocket watch movements as right away you improve your accuracy and dexterity. By practising being precise on these very small movements, working on larger ones becomes easy. It is vital that your screwdriver is correctly adjusted when working on these tiny movements.I would disassemble, clean, and oil and assemble again one of each of these different types of movements. As I went along I would notice what the differences in designs were exactly.BooksFor fault finding I followed the first eleven chapters of the Donald de Carle book Practical Watch Repairing. The book needs to be very carefully read as the author describes in detail the different methods of examination of the movement. I would have the book open as I worked on a movement, and followed the different examination steps along with the book. It is important to visualise the different exercises he describes. I made a list of notes for each chapter that allowed me to basically follow a check-list of the different areas to examine and check.Looking at a lot of different movements of the same kind allows you to feel what end-shakes and tolerances are correct and which are not. The only way to learn this is by touch.Practical Watch Repairing was the primary book I used during my experimentations. I of course had a look at Daniels’ Watchmaking and all the other de Carle and Fried titles but Practical Watch Repairing contained all the necessary fundamentals.Online coursesI bought two online courses whilst reading the above books. The thing about the books is that they don’t illustrate visually every single operation described in them. I knew I needed visual aid to begin with. First I bought the Christian Lass Watchmaking 101 course. It was very useful in showcasing the absolute fundamentals of watch repair which included the correct way of handling movements, adjusting screwdrivers, how to handle certain parts, description of various functions, and generally useful interjections here and there. I liked the fact he worked for Vianney Halter and had extensive experience in restoration. I found the course to be a great introduction and not much more. If I weren’t planning on attending watchmaking school I’d probably look into his Masterclass 1 course.It is not necessary to purchase online courses, unless you want to speed up your learning slightly. The books mentioned are excellent but only when you have a watch movement in front of you, and follow each instruction word by word. You don’t need to visualise anything with videos, you are simply shown a method right away. Learning from books is more rewarding as you work your way through the chapters, especially each time you successfully replicate what the words are instructing you to do.The second and last course I bought was Mark Lovick’s Level 3: Fault finding course. This course focused on the initial inspection, the fault finding pathway, testing the escapement, the train and power source, and the keyless and motion works. Basically it covers the respective Practical Watch Repairing chapters in video format. I found it useful but a little slow at times. Again, I might  as well just have spent more time following the books and using trial and error finding all this out by myself.Tools  …the watch repairer will discover ideas for tools of his own conception and will delight in making them.  \t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 2Get used to coming up with ideas for different tools and the methods in which you can fabricate them. Without a lathe or even a bench drill I was not able to make most tools I wanted to. I only managed to make some hand leavers (based on the sample lesson, pages 75 through 81, of the BHI Distance Learning Course), a screw-bluing plate, and a screw-polishing jig (which I had to get drilled by someone else so technically I only provided the design and measurements based on the diagram from p. 63 of Daniels’ Watchmaking). At the very least design your tools on paper with measurements, etc.Alternatively, you can buy old beat-up tools on eBay and restore them yourself. All that’s usually necessary is cleaning agents, rust remover solutions, an ultrasonic cleaner, and sandpaper. In my case I purchased a balance poising tool by Depose in very rough shape. Dismantling, de-rusting, polishing, cleaning, and lubricating it was very satisfying. I also bought a balance truing caliper by Star which only required a disassembly, a clean, some lubrication and a light polish.Dexterity exercisesI improved my dexterity by working on the smallest movements I could find. In my case these were vintage ladies movements of the AS 1012 variant. I unscrewed and screwed the smallest screws many times in a row to ensure I always got into the slot accurately. Lastly, I practised using tweezers as suggested by Daniels:  Choose a pair of which each limb is shaped with three facets to enable the tweezers to be rolled between the thumb and first two fingers when holding small objects. This is a knack which should be practised until the tweezers can be turned through 360° while holding a small component or a screw. Dexterity will improve with each practice and the tweezers, when used for holding small objects for examination on all surfaces, will become a finer extension of the fingers.  \t\tWatchmaking, 2011 revision by George Daniels, PWP, p. 31Especially with the smaller parts, you need to practise applying the correct pressure using tweezers so that they don’t fly off.All of the above proved very useful in the assessment and interview process of applying and getting into watchmaking school. I mentioned all this in my cover letter and in the interview.",

				"content": "The usual application and interview process for the WOSTEP 3’000-hour Program I applied for differed from previous years. Due to the unique situation of the year 2020, the typical assessment consisting of an interview, theory test (numerical and problem solving) and a dexterity test was replaced by an 2-hour online numeracy and logic multiple-choice test followed by a 30-minute video interview.The courseThe WOSTEP 3’000-hour Program is a course that provides full-time training which gives the opportunity to acquire the expertise of a watchmaker. Graduates are able to service, adjust (repair) and encase various products (both mechanical and electronic) available on the contemporary market. Watch repairers understand and apply various theoretical knowledge to repair situations where they may not have encountered a certain calibre or type of repair previously. Watch repairers are able to evaluate, adjust or manufacture certain components where necessary in order to resolve repairs.Initial applicationIn the cover letter I sent together with the initial application form for the course, I wrote about the reasons I am applying for the course, reasons for my change in career and fields, how and when I became interested in watches, which watchmaking books I read and what I tools and movements I worked with so far. I mentioned how my software programming skills apply to watchmaking: namely logic, problem solving, and critical thinking.Planned assessment dayAfter applying for the course with a cover letter expressing my motivation behind perusing watchmaking I was invited to an all-day assessment which was to consist of workshop exercises (practical puzzles and dexterity tests), written tests (logical reasoning, spacial awareness and numeracy), an interview, and a presentation on one of the three topics: 1. quartz watches, 2. watch and/or clock escapements or 3. history and/or development of timekeeping. I prepared a presentation entitled Spectral Analysis of Minute-Repeaters. For this I’ve extracted the chimes of five Patek Philippe minute-repeaters from YouTube, used an audio processing library for Python, and written tools to generate Mel Spectrograms and pace analysis tables.A few weeks before the assessment day I was informed it was called off due to a local lockdown, and that it would be replaced by an online test and a video interview.Online testThe online test contained about 40 multiple-choice questions which covered mathematics (solving basic quadratic equations), sequences, puzzles, and problem solving exercises. Some questions resembled these examples:I completed the test within about an hour and spent the other hour thoroughly checking my answers. A few days after completing the test, I received an invitation for a video interview.Video interviewDuring the video interview the interviewer asked what my motivation behind applying to the school was and double-checked whether the 3’000-hour course was right for me (the school also offers the shorter 1’800-hour technician course). I got the feeling that the interviewer wanted to see whether watchmaking was something I was passionate about or something I looked into briefly. Early in the interview he said I answered all his questions after showing him a box of watch movements I was working on and the tools I already bought, restored, or made myself. I never got to present my spectral analysis work.The schools are primarily looking for passionate candidates who didn’t pick watchmaking on a whim. This WOSTEP course states that no previous watchmaking experience is required but obviously the fact I did have some watch repair experience proved useful in the interview process and in eventually securing a place.Other coursesBefore applying, I researched courses other than the WOSTEP one I eventually chose, and inquired about the cost of the 2 year full-skill program in traditional watchmaking at the K&amp;H Watchmaking Competence Center. The location and cost of the course are the reasons I decided not to apply for it. The school is based in Le Locle, Switzerland where the estimated cost of living is around CHF 1200 to CHF 2000 per month. The cost of personal tools required for the course is about CHF 2000 and the final exam costs CHF 1500. The 5 day bench test costs CHF 850 (excluding living costs). The cost of the course is CHF 30,000 per year. In total, the estimated minimum cost of the two years of study is about CHF 78,750.Another option was the British Horological Institute Distance Learning Course which on paper costs much less than any watchmaking school but the cost of equipment would still be substantial. Additionally, I did not have the workshop space to dedicate to perusing this self-learning path.There are a number of brand watchmaking schools in Europe which I didn’t have a chance to look into. The alternate path of perusing an apprenticeship in watchmaking quickly become an impossibility due to the evolving pandemic.Motivations behind applying  Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more, and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.  1 Thessalonians 4:11-12Additional resources\tHow to Get into Watchmaking by No BS Watchmaker\tHow to Become a Watchmaker - Part One - Introduction by Colin Andrews\tWatchmaker Training and Education - How to Become a Watchmaker by Colin AndrewsRelated guides\tAdvice guide\tTraits guide",

Now God allowed Daniel to receive favor and compassion from the palace master. The palace master said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king; he has appointed your food and your drink. If he should see you in poorer condition than the other young men of your own age, you would endanger my head with the king.” Then Daniel asked the guard whom the palace master had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: “Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. You can then compare our appearance with the appearance of the young men who eat the royal rations, and deal with your servants according to what you observe.” So he agreed to this proposal and tested them for ten days. At the end of ten days it was observed that they appeared better and fatter than all the young men who had been eating the royal rations. So the guard continued to withdraw their royal rations and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables. To these four young men God gave knowledge and skill in every aspect of literature and wisdom; Daniel also had insight into all visions and dreams.   Daniel 1:8-17  One student shows me the hand exercises he does—pushing his fingers together like a slow-motion high five, or rotating his wrists—and says he’s sworn off alcohol, “at least for a long time,” because it might make his hand tremor.

				"content": "Posture in classics  If the watchmaker is so wrapped up in his work that he is not properly aware of his discomfort his health will soon suffer.  The height of benches and seats is important if comfort is to be assured during long periods of sitting. The seat should be of hard, polished wood, shaped at the front edge to relieve pressure on the thighs. A polished seat will allow slight changes in position while working, without shifting the weight of the body on to the feet. When seated the thighs should be horizontal and the lower leg vertical. If the foot is now moved forward or backward the knee will be lowered, allowing a change of position during the most concentrated work without having to move the seat. It is tiring to sit for long periods with the thighs sloping up or down from the body while the lower leg is vertical.  \t\tWatchmaking, 2011 revision by George Daniels, PWP, p. 3  The height of the stool is important. No general rule can be made, but it should enable the watch repairer to sit comfortably without the necessity of crouching down at the work. He should feel quite at ease.  \t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 4Feet should be touching the floor fully flat. Allow a clear sight of the work without forward curvature of the spine. It is better to raise the work to the level of sight rather than to lower the head to the level of the work. Sit with a straight back and relaxed. Be mindful of your posture and resolve issues as soon as you notice them.Additional publicationsAn industry document by the Swiss insurance company Suva on the ergonomics of workstations in precision work in the watch industry is available for download in French (original), as well as a machine-translated version in English. The document contains text and graphics in order to explore, analyse, and offer solutions for proper workshop working conditions:  Precision work is above all characterized by a vision-oriented activity. This determines the position of the eye (and therefore the head) relative to the work-piece. The position of the hands is a second determining factor. This is defined by the part to be worked and by the tools used. The position of the rest of the body adapts to the given conditions.  In order to prevent harmful postures, the workstation must be adapted at two levels:      the specific requirements of the activity, such as viewing distance, viewing angle, and hand position and posture;    the individual specificities of the worker, especially their size and visual acuity.    In order to meet these basic requirements, the workstation must meet the following conditions:      be height adjustable, or workbenches of different heights must be available;    arm or hand supports must be available for precision manual work; they are used to support the upper limbs and stabilize the hand; the height and angle of the stand must be adjustable;    the seat and the backrest must be individually adjustable;    the freedom of movement under the workbench and at chair level should not be obstructed.    Relaxed working atmosphere: In addition to physical nuisances, workers can also suffer from psychological disturbances, for example due to inadequate organization, too much pressure to perform or tensions between people. Negative stress can over time make you sick or make symptoms of other illnesses worse.  \tProper Workshop Working Conditions (English translation) by Suva, PDF, p. 9  Exercise and regeneration phases in the organization of work: A static posture leads to body pain and reduces the ability to concentrate. These symptoms are even stronger when a person is under stress. To remedy this effectively, regular breaks should be taken during work. These allow to regenerate the body, the eyes and the mind at the same time.Regeneration phases include eye relaxation exercises; getting up and taking a few steps helps stimulate the large muscle groups and improves blood circulation. To maintain health, everyone should also exercise regularly during leisure time.  \tProper Workshop Working Conditions (English translation) by Suva, PDF, p. 20",

				"title": "Good Works",
				"content": "PrologueListen carefully, my son, to the master’s instructions, and attend to them with the ear of your heart. This is advice from a father who loves you; welcome it, and faithfully put it into practice. The labor of obedience will bring you back to him from whom you had drifted through the sloth of disobedience. This message of mine is for you, then, if you are ready to give up your own will, once and for all, and armed with the strong and noble weapons of obedience to do battle for the true King, Christ the Lord.First of all, every time you begin a good work, you must pray to him most earnestly to bring it to perfection. In his goodness, he has already counted us as his sons, and therefore we should never grieve him by our evil actions. With his good gifts which are in us, we must obey him at all times that he may never become the angry father who disinherits his sons, nor the dread lord, enraged by our sins, who punishes us forever as worthless servants for refusing to follow him to glory.Let us get up then, at long last, for the Scriptures rouse us when they say: It is high time for us to arise from sleep (Rom 13:11). Let us open our eyes to the light that comes from God, and our ears to the voice from heaven that every day calls out this charge: If you hear his voice today, do not harden your hearts (Ps 94[95]:8).And again: You that have ears to hear, listen to what the Spirit says to the churches (Rev 2:7). And what does he say? Come and listen to me, sons; I will teach you the fear of the Lord (Ps 33[34]:12). Run while you have the light of life, that the darkness of death may not overtake you (John 12:35).Seeking his workman in a multitude of people, the Lord calls out to him and lifts his voice again: Is there anyone here who years for life and desires to see good days? (Ps 33[34]:13). If you hear this and your answer is “I do”, God then directs these words to you: If you desire true and eternal life, keep your tongue free from vicious talk and your lips from all deceit; turn away from evil and do good; let peace be your quest and aim (Ps 33[34]:14–15). Once you have done this, my eyes will be upon you and my ears will listen for your prayers; and even before you ask me, I will say to you: Here I am (Isa 58:9).What, dear brothers, is more delightful than this voice of the Lord calling to us? See how the Lord in his love shows us the way of life. Clothed then with faith and the performance of good works, let us set out on this way, with the Gospel for our guide, that we may deserve to see him who has called us to his kingdom (1 Thess 2:12).If we wish to dwell in the tent of this kingdom, we will never arrive unless we run there by doing good deeds. But let us ask the Lord and the Prophet: Who will dwell in your tent, Lord; who will find rest upon your holy mountains? (Ps 14[15]:1).After this question, brothers, let us listen well to what the Lord says in reply, for he shows us the way to his tent. One who walks without blemish, he says, and is just in all his dealings; who speaks the truth from his heart and has not practiced deceit with his tongue, who has not wronged a fellowman in any way, nor listened to slanders against his neighbor (Ps 14[15]2–3). He has foiled the evil one, the devil, at every turn, flinging both him and his promptings far from the sight of his heart. While these temptations were still young, he caught hold of them and dashed them against Christ (Ps 14[15]:4; 136[137]:9).These people fear the Lord, and do not become elated over their good deeds; they judge it is the Lord’s power, not their own, that brings about the good in them. They praise (Ps 14[15]:4) the Lord working in them, and say with the Prophet: Not to us, Lord, not to us give the glory, but to your name alone (Ps 113[115:1]:9). In just this way Paul the Apostle refused to take credit for the power of his preaching. He declared: By God’s grace I am what I am (1 Cor 15:10).And again he said: He who boasts should make his boast in the Lord (2 Cor 10:17). That is why the Lord says in the Gospel: Whoever hears these words of mine and does them is like a wise man who built his house upon rock; the floods came and the winds blew and beat against the house, but it did not fall: it was founded on rock (Matt 7:24–25).With this conclusion, the Lord waits for us daily to translate into action, as we should, his holy teachings. Therefore our life span has been lengthened by way of a truce, that we may amend our misdeeds. As the Apostle says: Do you not know that the patience of God is leading you to repent (Rom 2:4)?And indeed the Lord assures us in his love: I do not wish the death of the sinner, but that he turn back to me and live (Ezek 33:11).Brothers, now that we have asked the Lord who will dwell in his tent, we have heard the instruction for dwelling in it, but only if we fulfill the obligations of those who live there. We must, then, prepare our hearts and bodies for the battle of holy obedience to his instructions. What is not possible to us by nature, let us ask the Lord to supply by the help of his grace. If we wish to reach eternal life, even as we avoid the torments of hell, then—while there is still time, while we are in this body and have time to accomplish all these things by the light of life—we must run and do now what will profit us forever.Therefore we intend to establish a school for the Lord’s service. In drawing up its regulations, we hope to set down nothing harsh, nothing burdensome. The good of all concerned, however, may prompt us to a little strictness in order to amend faults and to safeguard love. Do not be daunted immediately by fear and run away from the road that leads to salvation. It is bound to be narrow at the outset. But as we progress in this way of life and in faith, we shall run on the path of God’s commandments, our hearts overflowing with the inexpressible delight of love. Never swerving from his instructions, then, but faithfully observing his teaching in the monastery until death, we shall through patience share in the sufferings of Christ that we may deserve also to share in his kingdom. Amen.The Tools for Good WorksFirst of all, love the Lord God with your whole heart, your whole soul and all your strength, and love your neighbor as yourself (Matt 22:37–39; Mark 12:30–31; Luke 10:27). Then the following: You are not to kill, not to commit adultery; you are not to steal nor to covet (Rom 13:9); you are not to bear false witness (Matt 19:18; Mark 10:19; Luke 18:20). You must honor everyone (1 Pet 2:17), and never do to another what you do not want done to yourself (Tob 4:16; Matt 7:12; Luke 6:31).Renounce yourself in order to follow Christ (Matt 16:24; Luke 9:23); discipline your body (1 Cor 9:27); do not pamper yourself; but love fasting. You must relieve the lot of the poor, clothe the naked, visit the sick (Matt 25:36), and bury the dead. Go to help the troubled and console the sorrowing.Your way of acting should be different from the world’s way; the love of Christ must come before all else. You are not to act in anger nor nurse a grudge. Rid your heart of all deceit. Never give a hollow greeting of peace or turn away when someone needs your love. Bind yourself to no oath lest it prove false but speak the truth with heart and tongue.Do not repay one bad turn with another (1 Thess 5:15; 1 Pet 3:9). Do not injure anyone, but bear injuries patiently. Love your enemies (Matt 5:44; Luke 6:27). If people curse you, do not curse them back but bless them instead. Endure persecution for the sake of justice (Matt 5:10).You must not be proud, nor be given to wine (Titus 1:7, 1 Tim 3:3). Refrain from too much eating or sleeping, and from laziness (Rom 12:11). Do not grumble or speak ill of others.Place your hope in God alone. If you notice something good in yourself, give credit to God, not to yourself, but be certain that the evil you commit is always your own and yours to acknowledge.Live in fear of judgment day and have a great horror of hell. Yearn for everlasting life with holy desire. Day by day remind yourself that you are going to die. Hour by hour keep careful watch over all you do, aware that God’s gaze is upon you, wherever you may be. As soon as wrongful thoughts come into your heart, dash them against Christ and disclose them to your spiritual father. Guard your lips from harmful or deceptive speech. Prefer moderation in speech and speak no foolish chatter, nothing just to provoke laughter; do not love immoderate or boisterous laughter.Listen readily to holy reading, and devote yourself often to prayer. Every day with tears and sighs confess your past sins to God in prayer and change from these evil ways in the future.Do not gratify the promptings of the flesh (Gal 5:16); hate the urgings of self-will. Obey the orders of the abbot unreservedly, even if his own conduct—which God forbid—be at odds with what he says. Remember the teaching of the Lord: Do what they say, not what they do (Matt 23:3).Do not aspire to be called holy before you really are, but first be holy that you may more truly be called so. Live by God’s commandments every day; treasure chastity, harbor neither hatred nor jealousy of anyone, and do nothing out of envy. Do not love quarreling; shun arrogance. Respect the elders and love the young. Pray for your enemies out of love for Christ. If you have a dispute with someone, make peace with him before the sun goes down.And finally, never lose hope in God’s mercy.These, then are the tools of the spiritual craft. When we have used them without ceasing day and night and have returned them on judgment day, our wages will be the reward the Lord has promised: What the eyes have not seen nor the ear heard, God has prepared for those who love him (1 Cor 2:9).The workshop where we are to toil faithfully at all these tasks is the enclosure of the monastery and stability in the community.",

				"title": "Humility",
				"content": "Restraint of SpeechLet us follow the Prophet’s counsel: I said, I have resolved to keep watch over my ways that I may never sin with my tongue. I have put a guard on my mouth. I was silent and was humbled, and I refrained even from good words (Ps 38[39]:2–3). Here the Prophet indicated that there are times when good words are to be left unsaid out of esteem for silence. For all the more reason, then, should evil speech be curbed so that punishment for sin may be avoided. Indeed, so important is silence that permission to speak should seldom be granted even to mature disciples, no matter how good or holy or constructive their talk, because it is written: In a flood of words you will not avoid sin (Prov 10:19); and elsewhere, The tongue holds the key to life and death (Prov 18:21). Speaking and teaching are the master’s task; the disciple is to be silent and listen.Therefore, any request to a superior should be made with all humility and respectful submission. We absolutely condemn in all places any vulgarity and gossip and talk leading to laughter, and we do not permit a disciple to engage in words of that kind.HumilityBrothers, divine Scripture calls to us saying: Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted (Luke 14:11; 18:14). In saying this, therefore, it shows us that every exaltation is a kind of pride, which the Prophet indicates he has shunned, saying: Lord, my heart is not exalted; my eyes are not lifted up and I have not walked in the ways of the great nor gone after marvels beyond me (Ps 130[131]:1). And why? If I had not a humble spirit, but were exalted instead, then you would treat me like a weaned child on its mother’s lap (Ps 130[131]:2).Accordingly, brothers, if we want to reach the highest summit of humility, if we desire to attain speedily that exaltation in heaven to which we climb by the humility of this present life, then by our ascending actions we must set up that ladder on which Jacob in a dream saw angels descending and ascending (Gen 28:12). Without doubt, this descent and ascent can signify only that we descend by exaltation and ascend by humility. Now the ladder erected is our life on earth, and if we humble our hearts the Lord will raise it to heaven. We may call our body and soul the sides of this ladder, into which our divine vocation has fitted the various steps of humility and discipline as we ascend.The first step of humility, then, is that a man keeps the fear of God always before his eyes (Ps 35[36]:2) and never forgets it. He must constantly remember everything God has commanded, keeping in mind that all who despise God will burn in hell for their sins, and all who fear God have everlasting life awaiting them. While he guards himself at every moment from sins and vices of thought and tongue, of hand or foot, of self-will or bodily desire, let him recall that he is always seen by God in heaven, that his actions everywhere are in God’s sight and are reported by angels every hour.The Prophet indicates this to us when he shows that our thoughts are always present to God, saying: God searches hearts and minds (Ps 7:9); again he says: The Lord knows the thoughts of men (Ps 93[94]:11); likewise, From afar you know my thoughts (Ps 138[139]:3); and, The thought of man shall give you praise (Ps 75[76]:11). That he may take care to avoid sinful thoughts: I shall be blameless in his sight if I guard myself from my own wickedness (Ps 17[18]:24).Truly, we are forbidden to do our own will, for Scripture tells us: Turn away from your desires (Sir 18:30). And in the Prayer too we ask God that his will be done in us (Matt 6:10). We are rightly taught not to do our own will, since we dread what Scripture says: There are ways which men call right that in the end plunge into the depths of hell (Prov 16:25). Moreover, we fear what is said of those who ignore this: They are corrupt and have become depraved in their desires (Ps 13[14]:1).As for the desires of the body, we must believe that God is always with us, for All my desires are known to you (Ps 37[38]:10), as the Prophet tells the Lord. We must then be on guard against any base desire, because death is stationed near the gateway of pleasure. For this reason Scripture warns us, Pursue not your lusts (Sir 18:30).Accordingly, if the eyes of the Lord are watching the good and the wicked (Prov 15:3), if at all times the Lord looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see whether any understand and seek God (Ps 13[14]:2); and if every day the angels assigned to us report our deeds to the Lord day and night, then, brothers, we must be vigilant every hour or, as the Prophet says in the psalm, God may observe us falling at some time into evil and so made worthless (Ps 13[14]:3). After sparing us for a while because he is a loving father who waits for us to improve, he may tell us later, This you did, and I said nothing (Ps 49[50]:21).The second step of humility is that a man loves not his own will nor takes pleasure in the satisfaction of his desires; rather he shall imitate by his actions that saying of the Lord: I have come not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me (John 6:38). Similarly we read, “Consent merits punishment; constraint wins a crown.”The third step of humility is that a man submits to his superior in all obedience for the love of God, imitating the Lord of whom the Apostle says: He became obedient even to death (Phil 2:8).The fourth step of humility is that in this obedience under difficult, unfavorable, or even unjust conditions, his heart quietly embraces suffering and endures it without weakening or seeking escape. For Scripture has it: Anyone who perseveres to the end will be saved (Matt 10:22), and again, Be brave of heart and rely on the Lord (Ps 26[27]:14). Another passage shows how the faithful must endure everything, even contradiction, for the Lord’s sake, saying in the person of those who suffer, For your sake we are put to death continually; we are regarded as sheep marked for slaughter (Rom 8:36; Ps 43[44]:22). They are so confident in their expectation of reward from God that they continue joyfully and say, But in all this we overcome because of him who so greatly loved us (Rom 8:37). Elsewhere Scripture says: O God, you have tested us, you have tried us as silver is tried by fire; you have led us into a snare, you have placed afflictions on our backs (Ps 65[66]:10–11). Then, to show that we ought to be under a superior, it adds: You have placed men over our heads (Ps 65[66]:12).In truth, those who are patient amid hardships and unjust treatment are fulfilling the Lord’s command: When struck on one cheek, they turn the other; when deprived of their coat, they offer their cloak also; when pressed into service for one mile, they go two (Matt 5:39–41). With the Apostle Paul, they bear with false brothers, endure persecution, and bless those who curse them (2 Cor 11:26; 1 Cor 4:12).The fifth step of humility is that a man does not conceal from his abbot any sinful thoughts entering his heart, or any wrongs committed in secret, but rather confesses them humbly. Concerning this, Scripture exhorts us: make known your way to the Lord and hope in him (Ps 36[37]:5). And again, Confess to the Lord, for he is good; his mercy is forever (Ps 105[106]:1; Ps 117[118]:1). So too the Prophet: To you I have acknowledged my offense; my faults I have not concealed. I have said: Against myself I will report my faults to the Lord, and you have forgiven the wickedness of my heart (Ps 31[32]:5).The sixth step of humility is that a monk is content with the lowest and most menial treatment, and regards himself as a poor and worthless workman in whatever task he is given, saying to himself with the Prophet: I am insignificant and ignorant, no better than a beast before you, yet I am with you always (Ps 72[73]:22–23).The seventh step of humility is that a man not only admits with his tongue but is also convinced in his heart that he is inferior to all and of less value, humbling himself and saying with the Prophet: I am truly a worm, not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people (Ps 21[22]:7). I was exalted, then I was humbled and overwhelmed with confusion (Ps 87[88]:16). And again, It is a blessing that you have humbled me so that I can learn your commandments (Ps 118[119]:71, 73).The eighth step of humility is that a monk does only what is endorsed by the common rule of the monastery and the example set by his superiors.The ninth step of humility is that a monk controls his tongue and remains silent, not speaking unless asked a question, for Scripture warns, In a flood of words you will not avoid sinning (Prov 10:19), and, A talkative man goes about aimlessly on earth (Ps 139[140]:12).The tenth step of humility is that he is not given to ready laughter, for it is written: Only a fool raises his voice in laughter (Sir 21:23).The eleventh step of humility is that a monk speaks gently and without laughter, seriously and with becoming modesty, briefly and reasonably, but without raising his voice, as it is written: “A wise man is known by his few words.”The twelfth step of humility is that a monk always manifests humility in his bearing no less than in his heart, so that it is evident at the Work of God, in the oratory, the monastery or the garden, on a journey or in the field, or anywhere else. Whether he sits, walks or stands, his head must be bowed and his eyes cast down. Judging himself always guilty on account of his sins, he should consider that he is already at the fearful judgment, and constantly say in his heart what the publican in the Gospel said with downcast eyes: Lord, I am a sinner, not worthy to look up to heaven (Luke 18:13). And with the Prophet: I am bowed down and humbled in every way (Ps 37[38]:7–9; Ps 118[119]:107).Now, therefore, after ascending all these steps of humility, the monk will quickly arrive at that perfect love of God which casts out fear (1 John 4:18). Through this love, all that he once performed with dread, he will now begin to observe without effort, as though naturally from habit, no longer out of fear of hell, but out of love for Christ, good habit and delight in virtue. All this the Lord will by the Holy Spirit graciously manifest in his workman now cleansed of vices and sins.",

				"title": "Obedience",
				"content": "ObedienceThe first step of humility is unhesitating obedience, which comes naturally to those who cherish Christ above all. Because of the holy service they have professed, or because of dread of hell and for the glory of everlasting life, they carry out the superior’s order as promptly as if the command came from God himself. The Lord says of men like this: No sooner did he hear than he obeyed me (Ps 17[18]:45); again he tells teachers: Whoever listens to you, listens to me (Luke 10:16). Such people as these immediately put aside their own concerns, abandon their own will, and lay down whatever they have in hand, leaving it unfinished. With the ready step of obedience, they follow the voice of authority in their actions. Almost at the same moment, then, as the master gives the instruction the disciple quickly puts it into practice in the fear of God; and both actions together are swiftly completed as one.It is love that impels them to pursue everlasting life; therefore, they are eager to take the narrow road of which the Lord says: Narrow is the road that leads to life (Matt 7:14). They no longer live by their own judgment, giving in to their whims and appetites; rather they walk according to another’s decisions and directions, choosing to live in monasteries and to have an abbot over them. Men of this resolve unquestionably conform to the sayings of the Lord: I have come not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me (John 6:38).This very obedience, however, will be acceptable to God and agreeable to men only if compliance with what is commanded is not cringing or sluggish or halfhearted, but free from any grumbling or any reaction of unwillingness. For the obedience shown to superiors is given to God, as he himself said: Whoever listens to you, listens to me (Luke 10:16). Furthermore, the disciples’ obedience must be given gladly, for God loves a cheerful giver (2 Cor 9:7). If a disciple obeys grudgingly and grumbles, not only aloud but also in his heart, then, even though he carries out the order, his action will not be accepted with favor by God, who sees that he is grumbling in his heart. He will have no reward for service of this kind; on the contrary, he will incur punishment for grumbling, unless he changes for the better and makes amends.The Good Zeal of MonksJust as there is a wicked zeal of bitterness which separates from God and leads to hell, so there is a good zeal which separates from evil and leads to God and everlasting life. This, then, is the good zeal which monks must foster with fervent love: They should each try to be the first to show respect to the other (Rom 12:10), supporting with the greatest patience one another’s weaknesses of body or behavior, and earnestly competing in obedience to one another. No one is to pursue what he judges better for himself, but instead, what he judges better for someone else. To their fellow monks they show the pure love of brothers; to God, loving fear; to their abbot, unfeigned and humble love. Let them prefer nothing whatever to Christ, and may he bring us all together to everlasting life.",

				"content": "  Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the road is easy that leads to destruction, and there are many who take it. For the gate is narrow and the road is hard that leads to life, and there are few who find it.  Matthew 7:13-14  Keep sober and alert, because your enemy the devil is on the prowl like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.  1 Peter 5:8Excerpts from George Daniels  On tools and machinery: On a general level it is assumed that a complex array of tools is required but I have not found this to be so. It is true that since the completion of my first watch by very nearly, if not quite, ‘cork and nail’ methods, the equipment in my workshop has expanded to include precision measuring and machining equipment. Although they make working easier they are not strictly necessary. Such tools are expensive to buy and a young watchmaking student would not have the money to purchase them. Nevertheless, precision machinery can save time and reduce the amount of concentration necessary to make small components by hand methods. The student can acquire these as advancing years bring reduced patience and increased income, but it should be remembered that if he cannot do the work well without machinery he will not improve with its aid.  On skills required to make all components of a watch: The only way to certain success is to become proficient in all the crafts represented in the complete watch [including the case, dial and hands] and to work without regard to so-called conventional hours of work.  On time frames: Watchmaking is more difficult [than service and repair] but more satisfying, although it involves many more consecutive hours of concentration the work is to be completed within a reasonable time.  On difficulties and self-sufficiency: It would be alien to my own philosophy to over-emphasize the difficulties that can beset the ambitious watchmaker. These are for overcoming and he will do this in his own way. I do not want to put too much value on commercialism either, but it is a fact of life that one must be self-sufficient if one is to be seen to be successful, and to be seen to be successful is to enhance success.  But there are no secrets in watchmaking. The methods are simple and commonplace and can be acquired with intelligent practice. Once the student has been shown a method of performing the many different kinds of work required for making a watch he can develop the confidence that comes from knowing there is nothing to be afraid of.  It should be the ambition of every professional to make a contribution to his field of study. This can only be achieved by constant striving for improvement. In watchmaking that contribution may be scientific, intellectual or aesthetic, for watches combine these three aspect to a degree depending upon their maker’s interest. Continuous study and practice are the ingredients for binding them into a successful whole. Much work will be necessary before this success is realized…  \t\tWatchmaking, 2011 revision by George Daniels, PWP, p. xiii-xviiExcerpts from Donald de Carle  Watch repairing is work which calls for a vast amount of intelligently concentrated application. It must be understood from the start that it cannot be picked up; it demands the most careful study.  Every watch repairer must aim at acquiring keen sight and a deft touch. He must have the fullest muscular control of his wrists and fingers, and be capable of peering closely at his work through an eye-glass for long periods at a stretch without tiring. These attributes of the repairer, if they are to be employed successfully, call for a high degree of bodily comfort, a clear head, a contented mind and a determination to succeed.  …he must be prepared to study closely, to sit close to the bench and to work to close limits. If he is prepared to do this and has a keen sight and a cool temperament then, with the necessary study and practice, he can succeed.  The key word is PRACTICE. Study is necessary, but practice is essential.  …the watch repairer will discover ideas for tools of his own conception and will delight in making them.  The essentials for success are scrupulous cleanliness, a clear bench and good light. Encourage comfort, warmth and quiet. Take the job seriously.  \t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 1-4  With short nails, and nice clean hands (our finest irreparable tools, and they are worth looking after) we shall stand a better chance of success.  \t\tPractical Watch Repairing, 3rd edition by Donald de Carle, NAG Press, p. 11Modern watchmakersPeter Speake-Marin’s website The Naked Watchmaker is an excellent resource for the student watchmaker. The People series is especially useful in the context of advice. Below are quotes from watchmakers and craftsmen interviewed by Speake-Marin where they answer the question: What advice would you give to a 20 something someone thinking of taking a similar path as you?  You have unique access to information today with the expanding internet as a source, if you have the passion and energy to do something different and new, go out there, inquire, practice, persevere and above all enjoy the adventure. If it’s your passion you will pursue and live it to the full. Slowly you can make a difference and help define the future by being an active part of it.Stephen Forsey  Be certain of your convictions and desires. Once this is acquired, never let yourself be diverted from your goals – stay on course, no matter what.Robert Greubel  Don’t.Stephen McGonigle  \tThe Naked Watchmaker, ‘People’ section by Peter Speake-MarinMcGonigle’s “don’t” answer is very reminiscent of Charles Bukowski’s epitaph “Don’t Try” and the subsequent analysis covered in the following work:  …if you have to try to try, if you have to try to care about something or have to try to want something, perhaps you don’t care about it, and perhaps you don’t want it.  …if the thought of not doing the thing hurts more than the thought of potentially suffering through the process, if the thought of a life without it or never having tried it at all terrifies you, if it comes to you, through you, out of you, almost as if you’re not trying, perhaps Bukowski might say here, try, and ‘if you’re going to try, go all the way.’  Otherwise, don’t even start.  \t\t\t\tDon’t Try - The Philosophy of Charles Bukowski by Persuit of Wonder, YouTubeMcGonigle’s answer to Speake-Marin’s question What are you most proud of? alludes a little bit to the above idea of Don’t Try:  I think I’m proud that I believed in myself (professionally) and took decisions that meant a tougher road but ultimately brought greater reward. I think I’ve always been honest and kept true to myself. I haven’t done anything that warrants shouting from the rooftops but I hope someday soon I will. I think too many of us, myself included, float through life without doing anything genuinely meaningful. There’s still time.Stephen McGonigle…What advice would you give to a 20 something someone thinking of taking a similar path as you? continued:  Everything takes time and we need lot of patience and time. We have to enjoy our daily life, this counts.  Kari Voutilainen  My path is very a-typical but a young person will need perseverance, curiosity, a brain, courage etc. to succeed anything. Just like me at the time, a young person has to find it all out by himself. I would also give the advice to stay away from dishonest people. Most importantly, and I also tell this to my kids, is to do something that you like. Don’t run after the money but follow your passion!Kees Engelbarts  Do things professionally and do things properly, in a structured way, to create a brand and timepieces that will last. By doing that, you will be taken seriously. Big brands can draw on their history and reputation; independent brands start with nothing and have to work hard to gain credibility and earn the trust of retailers and collectors. Whatever aspect it might be – precision, quality, finishing, customer service –  “almost” isn’t good enough.Romain Gauthier  I actually have to ask myself that every day (…) I don’t feel we ever have the answers ourselves; which makes the advice a moving target. Off the top of my head:      Don’t be afraid to ask the difficult questions, even if nobody else is.    Don’t be afraid to take risks, so long as you’re being objective about the probabilities and rewards.    Plan for the best, prepare for the worst.    Take everything you do and either double or halve it in the direction of conservativeness – and if the numbers still work, then go ahead.    Do not expect doing the same thing as everybody else will give you a significantly different outcome.    Perhaps the hardest bit: you can’t take it personally, but you have to take it personally to motivate yourself to go the extra mile. It’s therefore probably best if you ignore public opinion, or have somebody else to filter it for you.Ming Thein    “Choose a vehicle that is well-equipped with airbags!”…I would have the duty to warn them about the amount of energy they will have to deploy and maybe not succeed. But I can only support the will and the individual initiative, by which one attains true originality.Vianney Halter  Read books. Lots of them. Find books your tutors have never heard of. Find American, Chinese, Israeli or Russian books on horology. There is little new in the art and it has been studied in depth by diligent people. As the years go by you will start to read them with an ever more critical eye, picking out the good and the bad, as you yourself see fit.Robert Loomes  If you want to earn a lot quickly, then forget about the path of an independent watchmaker, because this is far from the most profitable business, for which on the contrary you need to devote an incredible amount of energy, time and yourself. Perhaps this is one of the most difficult ways that you can choose. And not at all as simple as it may seem from the outside. If nevertheless you embark on this path, you will face a huge number of different failures. Therefore, my advice is: don’t be afraid and always find strength to rise and move on to your goal. Be courageous, don’t look back at the opinions of others and do what comes from your heart. What I am most proud of is that I almost always find a way out of difficult situations (namely technical) and can quickly make unusual decisions. This is an indicator for me that I don’t stop on the spot, and try, overcoming myself, to set myself difficult tasks.Konstantin Chaykin  I would never discourage someone from pursuing their dream. I would however let them know that it takes hard work, determination, endurance, and the ability to push thru disappointment. I would also tell them to learn from their failures and mistakes, sometimes this is the most important aspect of pursuing anything. And always do what you love, you won’t be very good at something that you’re not passionate about.Roland G. Murphy  If I’m asked what to do to become an independent creative watchmaker, my advice is always to repair or just look at as many old watches as possible. And by old watches I don’t mean only the best watches by the old masters, but also cheap and heavily worn and used old watches from the flea marked. From these watches, one learns what works and what does not, which technical solutions ultimately do stand the test of time.Andreas Strehler  \tThe Naked Watchmaker, ‘People’ section by Peter Speake-MarinSchumann’s Advice to Young MusiciansRobert Schumann’s Advice to Young Musicians contains helpful wisdom intended for any artist-craftsman. Read this short selection in the context of watchmaking:  Nothing great can be achieved in art without enthusiasm.  Through diligent study and perseverance you will rise even higher.  The object of art is not to acquire wealth. Become a great artist, and other things will come.  Make sure your head is not turned by the applause of the crowd; that of the artist is of greater value.  Never help to popularise bad compositions. You should neither play them, nor, unless compelled, listen to them.  When you are older, don’t play fashionable stuff. Time is precious. All that is merely fashionable will soon become old-fashioned; and if you keep playing these works, you will become known as a charlatan whom nobody respects.  Respect the old highly, but also take a warm interest in the new. Don’t be prejudiced against names unknown to you.  Be sensitive to the requirements of your audience; but never play anything which you are inwardly ashamed.  In judging compositions, discriminate between works of real art and those designed merely for the entertainment of amateurs. Cherish the former, and don’t get angry at the latter.  Learn the fundamental principles of harmony as soon as you can. Don’t be afraid of the words theory, basso continuo, counterpoint, etc.; they will become your friends if you become theirs.  You must become acquainted by degrees with all the principle works of the important masters.  There is no end to learning.  Endeavour to play easy pieces well and beautifully; that is better than playing difficult pieces badly.  Play as if in the presence of a master.  When you have done your musical day’s work and feel tired, do not exert yourself further. It is better to rest than to work without pleasure and vigour.  Relieve the severity of your music studies by reading poetry. Take lots of walks!  Take care always to have your instrument well tuned.  The fingers must do what the head desires; not the contrary.  Be modest! Studying the history of music and hearing live performances of masterpieces from different periods will be the quickest cure for vanity or conceit.  \t\tRobert Schumann’s Advice to Young Musicians by Robert Schumann, F&amp;FAdditional resources\t\t\t\tGeorge Daniels interview playlist by Web of Stories, YouTube\tAdventures in Watchmaking, Introduction - What is this all about? by unknown",

				"content": "  Yet we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more, and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.  1 Thessalonians 4:11-12Independents on restorationAn overwhelming majority of independents have had the experience of working in vintage or antique watch and/or clock restoration before starting their own brands.  Immediately after graduation, I worked with my uncle. Working on these old pieces gave me a real physical sense of the history of the craft. I found it fascinating understanding why different watchmakers took different approaches over the years. I then focussed on the second half of the 18th Century, because it was far more developed with certain standards in place. The watches were more efficient, with a lot of cerebral challenges leading to moments of genius. I remember the first time I saw a marine chronometer, not even a particularly important one, but the quality of the solution and finishing was something I found very impressive.  \tFrom the bench: François-Paul Journe by A Collected Man  I began taking meetings in Geneva and found an auction house which was called Galerie d’Horlogerie Ancienne, which would later become Antiquorum, and they gave me a box of about 40 watches to restore for them. I did this for about five years or so, restoring old watches and pocket watches.  I learned a lot during that period. I got to understand so many different mechanisms with different approaches to the same kinds of problems. You begin to imagine how they achieved certain things with machinery that is long gone, it was very interesting. I became very fond of watches made between 1800 and 1920, because these are watches that, when restored, you can expect a good timekeeping result from. Watches before 1700, you’re just happy that it makes a tick tack sound when you’re done.  \tFrom the Bench: Philippe Dufour by A Collected Man  I admire old masters like Breguet, Berthoud etc. They were true masters and scientist mastering astronomy and inventors. They did first theory books for us.  I have restored watches made by these great masters, and it is something very special and impossible to describe the feeling once working on that type of timepiece.  \tThe Naked Watchmaker: Kari Voutilainen interview by Peter Speake-Marin  In Paris I first worked for a clockmaker restorer of antique clocks, then another restaurateur, antique watches this time.  \tThe Naked Watchmaker: Vianney Halter interview by Peter Speake-Marin  Read books.

As the years go by you will start to read them with an ever more critical eye, picking out the good and the bad, as you yourself see fit.  There are usually a few ways to approach any task in horology. People will bicker and snipe about which is correct. Try them all and see which one suits you, or best suits the particular task you need to accomplish.  \tThe Naked Watchmaker: Robert Loomes interview by Peter Speake-Marin  If I’m asked what to do to become an independent creative watchmaker, my advice is always to repair or just look at as many old watches as possible. And by old watches I don’t mean only the best watches by the old masters, but also cheap and heavily worn and used old watches from the flea marked. From these watches, one learns what works and what does not, which technical solutions ultimately do stand the test of time.  \tThe Naked Watchmaker: Andreas Strehler interview by Peter Speake-MarinAdditional resources\tOff Hours: Christian Lass interview Part I by J.
