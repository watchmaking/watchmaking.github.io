It is true that since the completion of my first watch by very nearly, if not quite, ‘cork and nail’ methods, the equipment in my workshop has expanded to include precision measuring and machining equipment. Although they make working easier they are not strictly necessary. Such tools are expensive to buy and a young watchmaking student would not have the money to purchase them. Nevertheless, precision machinery can save time and reduce the amount of concentration necessary to make small components by hand methods. The student can acquire these as advancing years bring reduced patience and increased income, but <strong>it should be remembered that if he cannot do the work well without machinery he will not improve with its aid</strong>.</p> <p><em>On skills required to make all components of a watch:</em> The only way to certain success is <strong>to become proficient in all the crafts represented in the complete watch</strong> [including the case, dial and hands] and <strong>to work without regard to so-called conventional hours of work</strong>.</p> <p><em>On time frames:</em> Watchmaking is more difficult [than service and repair] but more satisfying, although it involves many more consecutive hours of concentration the work is to be completed within a reasonable time.</p> <p><em>On difficulties and self-sufficiency:</em> <strong>It would be alien to my own philosophy to over-emphasize the difficulties that can beset the ambitious watchmaker. These are for overcoming and he will do this in his own way.</strong> I do not want to put too much value on commercialism either, but <strong>it is a fact of life that one must be self-sufficient</strong> if one is to be seen to be successful, and to be seen to be successful is to enhance success.</p> <p>But <strong>there are no secrets in watchmaking</strong>. The <strong>methods are simple and commonplace and can be acquired with intelligent practice</strong>. Once the student has been shown a method of performing the many different kinds of work required for making a watch he can develop the confidence that comes from knowing there is nothing to be afraid of.</p> <p>It should be the ambition of every professional to make a contribution to his field of study. This can only be achieved by <strong>constant striving for improvement</strong>. In watchmaking that contribution may be scientific, intellectual or aesthetic, for watches combine these three aspect to a degree depending upon their maker’s interest. <strong>Continuous study and practice</strong> are the ingredients for binding them into a successful whole. <strong>Much work will be necessary before this success is realized…</strong></p> <p><cite itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Book"> <meta itemprop="isbn" content="9780856677045"> <span itemprop="name">Watchmaking, 2011 revision</span> by <span itemprop="author">George Daniels</span>, <span itemprop="publisher" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization"><span itemprop="name">PWP</span></span>, <span itemprop="hasPart" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/PublicationVolume">p. <span itemprop="pagination">xiii-xvii</span></span> </cite></p> </blockquote> <h2 id="excerpts-from-donald-de-carle">Excerpts from Donald de Carle</h2> <blockquote> <p>Watch repairing is work which calls for <strong>a vast amount of intelligently concentrated application</strong>. It must be understood from the start that it cannot be picked up; <strong>it demands the most careful study</strong>.</p> <p>Every watch repairer must <strong>aim at acquiring keen sight and a deft touch</strong>. He must have the fullest muscular control of his wrists and fingers, and be capable of peering closely at his work through an eye-glass for long periods at a stretch without tiring. These attributes of the repairer, if they are to be employed successfully, call for <strong>a high degree of bodily comfort, a clear head, a contented mind and a determination to succeed</strong>.</p> <p><strong>…he must be prepared to study closely</strong>, to sit close to the bench and to work to close limits. If he is prepared to do this and has a keen sight and a cool temperament then, with the necessary study and practice, he can succeed.</p> <p>The key word is <em>PRACTICE</em>. <strong>Study is necessary, but practice is essential.</strong></p> <p>…the watch repairer will discover ideas for tools of his own conception and will delight in making them.</p> <p>The <strong>essentials for success are scrupulous cleanliness, a clear bench and good light.

The <em>People</em> series is especially useful in the context of advice. Below are quotes from watchmakers and craftsmen interviewed by Speake-Marin where they answer the question: <em>What advice would you give to a 20 something someone thinking of taking a similar path as you?</em></p> <blockquote> <p>You have unique access to information today with the expanding internet as a source, if you have the passion and energy to do something different and new, go out there, <strong>inquire, practice, persevere</strong> and above all enjoy the adventure. If it’s your passion you will pursue and live it to the full. Slowly you can make a difference and help define the future by being an active part of it. <cite>Stephen Forsey</cite></p> <p>Be certain of your convictions and desires.

I think I’ve always been honest and kept true to myself. I haven’t done anything that warrants shouting from the rooftops but I hope someday soon I will. I think too many of us, myself included, float through life without doing anything genuinely meaningful. There’s still time. <cite>Stephen McGonigle</cite></p> </blockquote> <p>…<em>What advice would you give to a 20 something someone thinking of taking a similar path as you?</em> continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>Everything takes time and <strong>we need lot of patience and time</strong>. We have to enjoy our daily life, this counts.</p> <p><cite>Kari Voutilainen</cite></p> <p>My path is very a-typical but a young person will need perseverance, curiosity, a brain, courage etc. to succeed anything. Just like me at the time, a young person has to find it all out by himself. I would also give the advice to stay away from dishonest people. Most importantly, and I also tell this to my kids, is to do something that you like. Don’t run after the money but follow your passion! <cite>Kees Engelbarts</cite></p> <p>Do things professionally and do things properly, in a structured way, to create a brand and timepieces that will last. By doing that, you will be taken seriously. Big brands can draw on their history and reputation; independent brands start with nothing and have to work hard to gain credibility and earn the trust of retailers and collectors. Whatever aspect it might be – precision, quality, finishing, customer service – <strong>“almost” isn’t good enough</strong>. <cite>Romain Gauthier</cite></p> <p>I actually have to ask myself that every day (…) I don’t feel we ever have the answers ourselves; which makes the advice a moving target. Off the top of my head:</p> <ol> <li>Don’t be afraid to <strong>ask the difficult questions</strong>, even if nobody else is.</li> <li>Don’t be afraid to <strong>take risks</strong>, so long as you’re being objective about the probabilities and rewards.</li> <li>Plan for the best, prepare for the worst.</li> <li>Take everything you do and either double or halve it in the direction of conservativeness – and if the numbers still work, then go ahead.</li> <li>Do not expect doing the same thing as everybody else will give you a significantly different outcome.</li> <li>Perhaps the hardest bit: you can’t take it personally, but you have to take it personally to motivate yourself to go the extra mile. It’s therefore probably best if you ignore public opinion, or have somebody else to filter it for you. <cite>Ming Thein</cite> </li> </ol> <p>“Choose a vehicle that is well-equipped with airbags!”… I would have the duty to warn them about the amount of energy they will have to deploy and maybe not succeed. But I can only support the will and the individual initiative, by which one attains true originality. <cite>Vianney Halter</cite></p> <p><strong>Read books.</strong> Lots of them. Find books your tutors have never heard of. Find American, Chinese, Israeli or Russian books on horology. There is little new in the art and it has been studied in depth by diligent people. As the years go by you will start to read them with an ever more critical eye, picking out the good and the bad, as you yourself see fit. <cite>Robert Loomes</cite></p> <p>If you want to earn a lot quickly, then forget about the path of an independent watchmaker, because this is far from the most profitable business, for which on the contrary you need to devote an incredible amount of energy, time and yourself. Perhaps this is one of the most difficult ways that you can choose. And not at all as simple as it may seem from the outside. If nevertheless you embark on this path, you will face a huge number of different failures. Therefore, my advice is: don’t be afraid and always find strength to rise and move on to your goal. Be courageous, don’t look back at the opinions of others and <strong>do what comes from your heart</strong>. What I am most proud of is that I almost always find a way out of difficult situations (namely technical) and can quickly make unusual decisions. This is an indicator for me that I don’t stop on the spot, and try, overcoming myself, to set myself difficult tasks. <cite>Konstantin Chaykin</cite></p> <p>I would never discourage someone from pursuing their dream. I would however let them know that <strong>it takes hard work, determination, endurance, and the ability to push thru disappointment</strong>. I would also tell them <strong>to learn from their failures and mistakes</strong>, sometimes this is the most important aspect of pursuing anything. And always do what you love, you won’t be very good at something that you’re not passionate about. <cite>Roland G. Murphy</cite></p> <p>If I’m asked what to do to become an independent creative watchmaker, my advice is always to <strong>repair or just look at as many old watches as possible</strong>. And by old watches I don’t mean only the best watches by the old masters, but also cheap and heavily worn and used old watches from the flea marked. From these watches, one learns what works and what does not, which technical solutions ultimately do stand the test of time. <cite>Andreas Strehler</cite></p> <p><cite itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/WebSite"> <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.thenakedwatchmaker.com/people" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span itemprop="name">The Naked Watchmaker, ‘People’ section</span></a> by <span itemprop="author">Peter Speake-Marin</span> </cite></p> </blockquote> <h2 id="schumanns-advice-to-young-musicians">Schumann’s Advice to Young Musicians</h2> <p>Robert Schumann’s <em>Advice to Young Musicians</em> contains helpful wisdom intended for any artist-craftsman. Read this short selection in the context of watchmaking:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Nothing great can be achieved in art without enthusiasm.</strong></p> <p>Through <strong>diligent study and perseverance</strong> you will rise even higher.</p> <p>The object of art is not to acquire wealth. Become a great artist, and other things will come.</p> <p>Make sure your head is not turned by the applause of the crowd; that of the artist is of greater value.</p> <p>Never help to popularise bad compositions. You should neither play them, nor, unless compelled, listen to them.</p> <p>When you are older, don’t play fashionable stuff. Time is precious. All that is merely fashionable will soon become old-fashioned; and if you keep playing these works, you will become known as a charlatan whom nobody respects.</p> <p><strong>Respect the old highly, but also take a warm interest in the new.</strong> Don’t be prejudiced against names unknown to you.</p> <p>Be sensitive to the requirements of your audience; but never play anything which you are inwardly ashamed.</p> <p>In judging compositions, <strong>discriminate between works of real art and those designed merely for the entertainment of amateurs</strong>. Cherish the former, and don’t get angry at the latter.</p> <p><strong>Learn the fundamental principles</strong> of harmony as soon as you can. Don’t be afraid of the words theory, <em>basso continuo</em>, counterpoint, etc.; they will become your friends if you become theirs.</p> <p>You must become acquainted by degrees with all the principle works of the important masters.</p> <p><strong>There is no end to learning.</strong></p> <p>Endeavour to play easy pieces well and beautifully; that is better than playing difficult pieces badly.</p> <p>Play as if in the presence of a master.</p> <p>When you have done your musical day’s work and feel tired, do not exert yourself further. It is better to rest than to work without pleasure and vigour.</p> <p>Relieve the severity of your music studies by reading poetry. <strong>Take lots of walks!</strong></p> <p>Take care always to have your instrument well tuned.</p> <p>The fingers must do what the head desires; not the contrary.</p> <p><strong>Be modest!</strong> Studying the history of music and hearing live performances of masterpieces from different periods will be the quickest cure for vanity or conceit.</p> <p><cite itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Book"> <meta itemprop="isbn" content="9780571355686"> <span itemprop="name">Robert Schumann’s Advice to Young Musicians</span> by <span itemprop="author">Robert Schumann</span>, <span itemprop="publisher" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization"><span itemprop="name">F&amp;F</span></span> </cite></p> </blockquote> <h2 id="additional-resources">Additional resources</h2> <p><cite itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/VideoObject"> <meta itemprop="uploadDate" content="13 July 2017"> <meta itemprop="description" content="English watch-maker George Daniels (1926-2011) was most famous for creating the co-axial escarpment and could make a complete watch by hand."> <meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl" content="https://img.youtube.com/vi/10bpIC1g8tM/0.jpg"> <a itemprop="contentUrl" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVV0r6CmEsFzkr4WCsqrhvkOpA-pLIGmS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span itemprop="name">George Daniels interview playlist</span></a> by <span itemprop="author">Web of Stories</span>, YouTube </cite></p> <p><cite itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/WebSite"> <a itemprop="url" href="https://watchmaking.weebly.com/introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span itemprop="name">Adventures in Watchmaking, Introduction - What is this all about?</span></a> by <span itemprop="author">unknown</span> </cite></p> </div> </article> </div> </main> <footer itemprop="hasPart" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/WPFooter"> <div class="container row"> <div class="col-12"> <ul> <li><a href="/feed.xml">RSS Feed</a></li> <a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to top ↑</a> <li><a href="/disclaimers">Disclaimers</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <p class="ora-et-labora">Ora et Labora</p> </footer> </body> </html>
